<h1><i>THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</i></h1>


<p><i>Seventy-five years have passed since Lingard completed his</i> <span class="smcap">History of
England</span>, <i>which ends with the Revolution of 1688. During that period
historical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of
materials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have
been thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been
corrected. Many notable works have been written on various periods of
our history; some of them at such length as to appeal almost exclusively
to professed historical students. It is believed that the time has come
when the advance which has been made in the knowledge of English history
as a whole should be laid before the public in a single work of fairly
adequate size. Such a book should be founded on independent thought and
research, but should at the same time be written with a full knowledge
of the works of the best modern historians and with a desire to take
advantage of their teaching wherever it appears sound.</i></p>

<p><i>The vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a
History of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing
state of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly
advisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an
attempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained
by research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different
writers, each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> of them chosen as being specially capable of dealing with
the period which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each
author as free a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity
in method of treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their
contents, as well as in their outward appearance, form one History.</i></p>

<p><i>As its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,
with the History of England and, after the date of the union with
Scotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of
a nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be
understood without taking into account the various forces acting upon
it, notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and
economic progress will also find place in these volumes. The footnotes
will, so far as is possible, be confined to references to authorities,
and references will not be appended to statements which appear to be
matters of common knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume
will have an Appendix giving some account of the chief authorities,
original and secondary, which the author has used. This account will be
compiled with a view of helping students rather than of making long
lists of books without any notes as to their contents or value. That the
History will have faults both of its own and such as will always in some
measure attend co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains have
been spared to make it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of the
greatness of its subject.</i></p>

<p><i>Each volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in
itself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and
will have its own index, and two or more maps.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>THE KING AND BUTE.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_1" id="TOPIC_1"></a>George III. was in his twenty-third year when he succeeded
his grandfather, George II., on October 25, 1760. His accession
caused general satisfaction. The jacobite schism had come to
an end; no one imagined that a restoration of the exiled house
was possible, or seriously wished that it might take place. The
remembrance of the rising of '45 strengthened the general feeling
of loyalty to the reigning house; the Old Pretender had
lost all interest in public affairs, and his son, Charles Edward,
was a confirmed drunkard, and had alienated his friends by his
disreputable life. Englishmen were determined not to have
another Roman catholic king, and they were too proud of their
country willingly to accept as their king a prince who was
virtually a foreigner as well as a papist, and whose cause had
in past years been maintained by the enemies of England. It
is true that their last two kings had been foreigners, but this was
so no longer; their new king had been born and brought up
among them and was an Englishman to the backbone. He
succeeded an old king of coarse manners and conversation and
of openly immoral life, and his youth and the respectability of
his morals added to the pleasure with which his people greeted
him as a sovereign of their own nation.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_2" id="TOPIC_2"></a>National feeling was growing in strength; it had been kindled
by Pitt, and fanned into a flame by a series of victories which
were largely due to the inspiration of his lofty spirit. He had
raised Great Britain from a low estate to a height such as it had
never reached before. The French power had been overthrown
in North America and the dominion of Canada had been added
to the British territories. In India the victories of Clive and his
generals were soon to be crowned by the fall of Pondicherry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and French and Dutch alike had already lost all chance of
successfully opposing the advance of British rule by force of
arms. Great Britain had become mistress of the sea. Her
naval power secured her the possession of Canada, for her ships
cut off the garrison of Montreal from help by sea; it sealed the
fate of the French operations in India, for D'Ach&eacute; was forced
to withdraw his ships from the Coromandel coast and leave
Lally without support. In the West Indies Guadeloupe had
fallen, and in Africa Goree. In every quarter the power of
France was destroyed, her colonies were conquered, her ships
captured or driven from the sea.</p>

<p>The naval supremacy of England is attested, strange as it
seems at first sight, by her losses in merchant shipping, which
were far heavier than those of France, more than 300 in 1760,
more than 800 in 1761, for many English merchantmen were
at sea while the French dared not send out their merchant ships
for fear of capture. Nor was this all, for the ruin of the commerce
of France led the shipowners of St. Malo to fit out many
of their ships as privateers and corsairs, and the ruin of her
navy sent many a fine seaman aboard them. Skippers of English
traders who straggled from their convoy, or sailed ahead of
it in order to be first in the market, were often punished for
their obstinacy or greediness by these fast-sailing privateers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
In spite of these losses, England's supremacy at sea caused
a rapid increase in her wealth and commerce, and she took
full advantage of her power, seizing French merchandise carried
in neutral vessels. The wealth acquired through her naval
supremacy enabled her to uphold the cause of her allies
on the continent. England's purse alone afforded Frederick of
Prussia the means of keeping the field, and the continuance of
the war depended on her subsidies. The continental war, in
which our troops played a secondary part, was by no means so
popular as the naval war, yet under Pitt's administration it had
helped to rouse the spirit of the nation. A new militia had been
created and the old jealousy of a standing army was weakened.
It was, then, at a time when national feeling was strong that
Englishmen were called upon to welcome a king of their own
nationality, and they answered to the call with enthusiasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE YOUNG KING.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_3" id="TOPIC_3"></a>George was in many respects worthy of their welcome.
Moral in his conduct and domestic in his tastes, he set an
example of sobriety and general decency of behaviour. He
was kind-hearted and had the gift of pleasing. On public
occasions his demeanour and words were dignified. In private
he talked in a homely way, his words following one another
too quickly and sometimes showing a confusion of thought and
excitability of brain. To the poor he would speak with familiar
kindness, chatting with them like a good-natured squire. Yet
simple as he was in his habits and private talk, he always spoke
and acted as a gentleman; the coarseness of the old court was
a thing of the past. He was deeply and unaffectedly pious, and
was strongly attached to the Church of England; his religion
was of a sober kind and was carried into his daily life. He was
constantly guided by the dictates of his conscience. His will
was strong; and as his conscience was by no means always so
well-informed as he believed it to be, his firmness often deserved
the name of obstinacy. Nor, in common with the best of men,
did he always clearly distinguish between his personal feelings
and conscientious convictions. He had great self-control, and
was both morally and physically courageous. Though as a
youth he had been idle, he was never addicted to pleasure;
his accession brought him work which was congenial to him,
he overcame his natural tendency to sloth and, so long as his
health allowed, discharged his kingly duties with diligence. His
intellectual powers were small and uncultivated, but he had
plenty of shrewdness and common sense; he showed a decided
ability for kingcraft, not of the highest kind, and gained many
successes over powerful opponents. The welfare of his people
was dear to him; he was jealous for the honour of England,
rejoiced in her prosperity, and strove with all his strength to
save her from humiliation. In religion, tastes, and prejudices
he was in sympathy with the great mass of his people; and in
matters in which his policy and conduct seem most open to
censure, he had the majority of the nation with him.</p>

<p>He had, however, some serious failings which brought trouble
both on his people and himself. They were largely the results
of his training. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, a fool,
a fribble and worse, died when George was twelve years old.
His mother, the Princess Augusta, was a woman of strong will,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
ambitious of power, unamiable in temper, thoroughly insincere,
narrow-minded, and full of petty feelings. She was strict in all
religious matters, had a high sense of duty, and was a careful
mother. When her son became king, she acted as though she
had a right to direct him in his political work. Her interference
was mischievous: she was unpopular and incapable of understanding
the politics of a great country; for she had the
prejudices of a little German court, and regarded politics
merely in a personal light. George grew up completely under
her influence. Jealous of her authority and influence over her
sons, she was quick to suspect their governors and preceptors
of trying to act independently of her, and thwarted them continually.
They had no chance of gaining George's confidence
or of giving him the benefits which a lad may derive from the
society of men experienced in the ways of the world. Do what
they would, the princess was always too strong for them, and
Lord Waldegrave, one of the prince's governors, records as his
own experience that "the mother and the nursery always prevailed".
Nor had George the opportunity of learning anything
from companions of his own age; his mother was afraid that
his morals would be corrupted by association with young people,
and kept him in the strictest seclusion. He had no friend
except his brother Edward. Her jealousy extended to her
children's nearest relations. They had little intercourse with
the court, and William, Duke of Cumberland, whose upright
character and soldierly qualities might well have endeared him
to his nephews, complained that as children they were taught to
regard him with the most unworthy suspicion.</p>

<p>Brought up among bed-chamber women and pages, in an
unwholesome atmosphere of petty intrigue, and carefully kept
from contact with the world, George had the failings which such
a system might be expected to produce. His mother certainly
succeeded in implanting in his heart religious principles which
he preserved through life, and she turned him out a pure-minded
and well-bred young man; but the faults in his character were
confirmed. He was uncharitable in his judgments of others and
harsh in his condemnation of conduct which he did not approve.
His prejudices were strengthened; he put too high a value on
his own opinions and was extremely stubborn. In dealing with
men, he thought too much of what was due to himself and too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
little of what was due to others. As a lad he lacked frankness,
and in later life was disingenuous and intriguing. When he
was displeased his temper was sullen and resentful. He was
always overcareful about money, and in old age this tendency
developed into parsimony. His education was deficient; it had
not been carried on steadily, and he had been allowed to indulge
a constitutional inertness. Though he overcame this habit, the
time which he had lost could not be made up for, and ideas
which might have been corrected or enlarged by a more thorough
education, remained firmly fixed in his mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EARL OF BUTE.</i></div>

<p>Among these ideas were an exaggerated conception of the
royal prerogative and the belief that it was his duty as king to
govern as well as to reign. His mother's constant exhortation
to him, "George, be a king," fell upon willing ears, and appears
to have been enforced by his tutors. A more powerful influence
on the mind of the young prince than that of any of his tutors
was exercised by John Stuart, Earl of Bute, his mother's chief
friend and adviser. He was a fine showy man, vain of his
handsome person, theatrical in his manners, pompous, slow and
sententious in his speech. His private life was respectable; he
had literary and scientific tastes, and a good deal of superficial
knowledge. His abilities were small; he would, George's father
used to say, "make an excellent ambassador in any court where
there was nothing to do".<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He lacked the steadfast self-reliance
necessary to the part which he undertook to play, and had none
of the dogged resolution of his royal pupil. His enemies freely
accused him of falsehood; he was certainly addicted to intrigue,
but he was probably too proud a man to utter direct lies. The
friendship between him and the princess was close and lasting.
It was generally believed that he was her paramour, but for this
there is no real evidence. It would have been contrary to the
character of the princess, and the assertion seems to have been a
malicious scandal. George liked him, and when he was provided
with a household of his own in 1756, he persuaded the
king to put the earl at the head of it as his groom of the stole.
Though utterly incompetent for the task, Bute instructed the
prince in the duties of kingship; he encouraged him in the idea
that a king should exercise a direct control over public affairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and is said to have borrowed for him a portion of Blackstone's
then unpublished <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> in
which the royal authority is magnified.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_4" id="TOPIC_4"></a>George's political system was, it is evident, largely based on
Bolingbroke's essay <i>On the Idea of a Patriot King</i>. In this
essay Bolingbroke lays down that a king who desires the welfare
of his people should "begin to govern as soon as he begins
to reign," that he must choose as his ministers men who "will
serve on the same principles on which he intends to govern,"
and that he must avoid governing by a party. Such a king
will unite his people, and put himself at their head, "in order
to govern, or more properly subdue, all parties". This doctrine
seemed specially appropriate to the state of affairs at George's
accession. During the last two reigns the power of the crown
had dwindled. Neither George I. nor George II. had cared
for, or indeed understood, domestic politics, and the government
had fallen into the hands of the whig party which became
dominant at the Revolution. The whigs posed as defenders of
the Hanoverian house and of the principles of 1688. Those
principles limited the exercise of the prerogative, but they did
not involve depriving the crown of all participation in the
government. The whig party exaggerated them, and while the
fortunes of Hanover and continental affairs absorbed the attention
of the king, they completely usurped the government of the
country. They were strong in the house of lords, and secured
their position in the commons by employing the patronage of
the crown, the money of the nation, and their own wealth and
influence to control the borough elections. For nearly fifty
years a small number of whig lords shared the government of
the country among themselves. During Walpole's administration
the whigs became split into sections. Several of the more
powerful lords of the party had each his own following or "connexion"
in parliament, composed of men bound to him by
family ties, interest, or the gift of a seat. These sections, while
they agreed in keeping the crown out of all part in the government,
and the tories out of all share in the good things which
the crown had to bestow, struggled with one another for office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING INTENDS TO RULE.</i></div>

<p>Meanwhile the tories were left out in the cold. So long as
jacobitism was a danger to the state, this was not a fair cause
of complaint, for many tories had corresponded with the exiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
princes. By 1760, however, tories had become as loyal as
whigs. George was fully determined to put an end to this
state of things: he would be master in his own kingdom; he
and not the whigs should govern England. He naturally rejoiced
to see the tories, a large and important body of his
subjects, reconciled to the throne; and as he had been brought
up in tory principles, he welcomed with peculiar pleasure the
support of the party of prerogative. The tories were no longer
to be neglected by the crown; the whig monopoly was to be
brought to an end. He did not contemplate taking political
power from one party in order to vest it in another. He designed
to rule independently of party; no political section was
necessarily to be excluded from office, but no body of men,
whether united by common principles or common interest, was
henceforth to dictate to the crown. To be willing and able to
carry on the government in accordance with his will was to be
the sole qualification for a share in the administration. Ministers
might or might not be agreed on matters of the first importance;
all the agreement between them which was necessary was that
each in his own sphere should act as an agent of the king's policy.</p>

<p>The system was not so impossible as it would be at present.
The idea of the cabinet as a homogeneous body, collectively
responsible to parliament, was not yet established. Government
was largely carried on by ministers working more or less independently
of one another. In 1760 the cabinet, an informal
committee of the privy council, was an institution of a different
character from that of to-day. During the last two reigns it
had included, along with the ministers holding the chief political
offices, whether of business or dignity, certain great court officials,
and some other personages of conspicuous position whose assistance
might be useful to the government. Nominally the "lords
of the cabinet" were fairly numerous. They did not all take an
equal share in government. The king's "most serious affairs"
were directed by not more than five or six of them, who formed
a kind of inner cabinet, the first lord of the treasury, the two
secretaries of state, one or more of the principal supporters of
the administration, and generally the lord chancellor. They
discussed matters privately, sometimes settling what should be
laid before a cabinet meeting, and sometimes communicating
their decisions to the king as the advice of his ministers, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
submitting them to the cabinet at large.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Outside this small
inner circle the lords of the cabinet held a position rather of
dignity than of power, and some of them rarely attended a
cabinet meeting.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This arrangement was mainly due to the
long predominance of Sir Robert Walpole and to the overwhelming
political influence of a few great whig houses. The strife
among the whigs which followed Walpole's retirement and the
critical character of foreign affairs tended to increase the number
of councillors who commonly took part in cabinet business.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CABINET.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_5" id="TOPIC_5"></a>The first cabinet of George III. as settled with reference to
a meeting held on November 17, consisted of the keeper of the
great seal (Lord Henley), the president of the council (Lord
Granville), the two secretaries of state (Pitt and Holdernesse),
the Duke of Newcastle (first lord of the treasury), Lord Hardwicke
(ex-chancellor), Lord Anson (first lord of the admiralty),
Lord Ligonier (master-general of the ordnance), Lord Mansfield
(lord chief-justice), the Duke of Bedford (lord-lieutenant
of Ireland) and the Duke of Devonshire (lord chamberlain).
If Lord Halifax (president of the board of trade) pleased, he
might attend to give information on American affairs; and Newcastle
suggested that Legge (the chancellor of the exchequer,
whose office, as finance was then largely managed by the first
lord of the treasury, was of less importance than it soon became)
and the "solicitor" (Charles Yorke, solicitor-general) should
also be summoned.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Soon afterwards Bute was appointed groom
of the stole to the king and entered the cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> After 1760
the cabinet began to assume its later form; questions of the
highest importance were debated and decided on in meetings
of eleven or twelve councillors, and in 1761 Hardwicke
complained that the king's "most serious affairs" were discussed
by as many as would in earlier days have formed
a whole cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> From 1765 the existence of an inner circle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
becomes less distinct, though at all times a prime minister
naturally takes counsel privately with the most prominent or
most trusted members of his government. Non-efficient members
of a cabinet appear more rarely until, in 1783, they disappear
altogether. The old inner cabinet becomes expanded into
a council consisting generally of high political officers, and
the members, ten or twelve in number, discuss and settle the
weightiest affairs of state. With the critical negotiations with
France in 1796 came a new development; the prime minister,
the younger Pitt, and Lord Grenville, the foreign secretary,
arranged that the British ambassador should write private
despatches for their information, and others of a less confidential
character which might be read by the cabinet at large.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Here
a new inner cabinet is foreshadowed. It differed from the old
one: that arose from the small number who were entrusted with
an actual share in the government; this, from the fact that the
number of the king's confidential servants was so large that it
was advisable that certain matters of special secrecy should
only be made known to and discussed by two or three. The
subsequent increase of the council promoted the development of
an inner cabinet, and such a body is understood to have existed
for many years during which cabinets have been of a size
undreamt of by ministers of George III.</p>

<p>The solidarity of the cabinet is now secured by the peculiar
functions and powers of a prime minister.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It was not so at
the accession of George III. That there should be an avowed
prime minister possessing the chief weight in the council and
the principal place in the confidence of the king is a doctrine
which was not established until the first administration of the
younger Pitt; and though the title of prime minister had come
into use by 1760, it was still regarded as invidious by constitutional
purists. According to George's system he was himself to
be the only element of coherence in a ministry; it was to be
formed by the prime minister in accordance with his instructions,
and each member of it was to be guided by his will.
The factious spirit of the whigs, the extent to which they
monopolised power, and the humiliating position to which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
had reduced the crown, afford a measure of defence for his
scheme of government. Yet it was in itself unconstitutional,
for it would have made the ministers who were responsible to
parliament mere agents of the king who was not personally
responsible for his public acts. And it was not, nor indeed
could it be, carried out except by adopting means which were
unconstitutional and disastrous. It necessarily made the king
the head of a party. He needed votes in parliament, and he
obtained them, as the whig leaders had done, by discreditable
means. If his ministers did not please him he sought support
from the members of his party, "the king's friends," as they were
called; and so there arose an influence behind the throne distinct
from and often opposed to that of his responsible advisers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S SCHEME.</i></div>

<p>Since 1757 the strife of the whig factions had been stilled
by coalition. At the king's accession the administration was
strong. It owed its strength to the co-operation of the Duke
of Newcastle, the first lord of the treasury, and Pitt, secretary
of state.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Newcastle, the most prominent figure among the
great whig nobles, derived his power from influence; he had an
unrivalled experience in party management and as a dispenser
of patronage, and though personally above accepting a bribe
of any kind, he was an adept at corrupt practices. He would
have been incapable of conducting the war, for he was ignorant,
timid, and vacillating, but he knew how to gain the support of
parliament and how to find the supplies which the war demanded.
Pitt was strong in the popular favour which he had
gained by his management of the war; he was supremely fitted
to guide the country in time of war, but he was too haughty
and imperious to be successful in the management of a party.
He did not care to concern himself about applications for
bishoprics, excisorships, titles, and pensions, or the purchase of
seats in parliament. All such work was done by Newcastle.
For his attack on the whig party George needed a scheme and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a man&mdash;some one to act for him in matters in which as king he
could not appear personally to interfere. The man was ready
to his hand, his friend and teacher, Bute. His scheme of
attack was to create a division between Newcastle and Pitt, to
make peace with France, and force Pitt to leave the ministry,
Pitt's resignation would weaken the whigs, and the king would
be in a position to give office to Bute and any other ministers
he might choose. Newcastle and Pitt were not really in accord,
for not only was Newcastle jealous of Pitt, but he was anxious
to bring the war to an end while Pitt wished to continue it.
George therefore started on his work of sowing dissension
between them with something in his favour. He disliked Pitt's
war policy. He and Bute desired peace, no doubt for its own
sake, as well as because it would forward their plan, for when
the war ended the great war minister would no longer be
necessary to the whigs.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_6" id="TOPIC_6"></a>On the day of his accession George privately offered to
make Bute a secretary of state.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He refused the offer, for to
have stepped into the place of Holdernesse while the whig
party was still united would have been premature. The
council was immediately summoned to Carlton house, a residence
of the princess-dowager. George at once showed that
he would take a line of his own. After a few gracious words
to Newcastle in private audience, he closed the interview by
saying, "My lord Bute is your very good friend and will tell
you my thoughts at large". The duke, Pitt, and Holdernesse
were called into the closet to hear the declaration he was about
to make to the privy council; it is said to have been written by
the king himself with the help of Bute. When it had been
read George merely asked if anything was "wrong in point of
form". Pitt could scarcely believe his ears; the war was described
as "bloody and expensive". He had an interview with
Bute in the evening and insisted on a change in the sentence.
He carried his point, and the words in the council-book with
reference to the war are: "As I mount the throne in the midst
of an expensive, but just and necessary war, I shall endeavour
to prosecute it in a manner most likely to bring about an
honourable and lasting peace in concert with my allies". The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
last five words were dictated by Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Bute having been
sworn of the privy council, and having entered the cabinet as
groom of the stole, assumed "a magisterial air of authority,"
and was universally recognised as the king's confidant and
mouthpiece.</p>

<p>The king opened parliament on November 19, wearing his
crown. His speech was settled by his ministers, and was sent
to Bute for his perusal, Newcastle intending himself to lay it
before the king, as it was his right to do.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Bute, however, took
it to the king, and Newcastle to his amazement received it back
from the earl with an additional clause written by the king's
hand, and a message that the king would have it inserted in the
speech which was to be laid before him next day in cabinet
council.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The clause began: "Born and educated in this
country, I glory in the name of Britain" [<i>sic</i>], and went on to
express the king's confidence in the loyalty of his people and his
desire to promote their welfare.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The words were unexceptionable,
but the absolute command to insert them in the speech for
which the ministers, not the king, were responsible, was unwise.
The use of the word Britain was attributed to the Scotsman
Bute. In later life the king declared that he had written the
clause without suggestion from any one.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> His command was
obeyed, and the manner in which his words were received illustrates
the adulation then customarily rendered to the sovereign.
Hardwicke, who was in the habit of composing addresses for
his colleagues, seems to have taken "Britain" for "Briton," as
indeed it usually appears in print, and inserted a clause in the
lords' address ending with&mdash;"What a lustre does it cast on the
name of Briton when you, Sir, are pleased to esteem it among
your glories!" When whig lords could adopt such words as
these, a young king might well be encouraged to think over-highly
of the royal prerogative. The incident has a special
interest. The cabinet council of the 17th, in which the speech
was read in its final form, was held by the king in person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
By the end of the last reign it had become unusual that the king
should preside at cabinet meetings. With one doubtful exception,
George III. never again presided at a meeting, and so
the absence of the sovereign from the deliberations of the cabinet
became an established constitutional usage. Thus at the time
when the king was preparing to assume a preponderance in the
government, the crown finally abandoned one of the few remaining
customs which indicated a right to govern as well as to reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CIVIL LIST.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_7" id="TOPIC_7"></a>A like contrast is afforded by the arrangement of the civil
list. George was the first sovereign who entirely surrendered
his interest in the hereditary revenues of the crown in England,
and placed them at the disposal of parliament. In return parliament
voted him a civil list, or fixed revenue, "for the support of
his household and the dignity of the crown". The sum voted
was &pound;800,000 a year, which was at first charged with some
pensions to members of the royal family. By this arrangement
the control of parliament over the king's expenditure was
asserted at a time when the king was relying on his prerogative
to enable him to become independent of ministerial control.
Besides this income George had the hereditary revenues from
Scotland, a civil list in Ireland, the duchies of Cornwall and
Lancaster, and certain admiralty and other dues, the whole
amounting to "certainly not much short of a million annually".<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
If the value of money at the time is considered, it may be allowed
that the crown was amply provided for, and that so thrifty
a king as George would always have found his revenues
sufficient for his needs, if he had not spent large sums in supplying
pensions and places of profit for his political adherents,
and in other methods of corruption. The good impression
made by the young king was heightened by a speech from the
throne on March 3, 1761, recommending that in order to complete
the independence of judges, their commission should not
for the future be terminated by the demise of the crown, and
that sufficient salaries should be assigned to them. An act to
that effect was accordingly passed. On the 19th the king closed
the session, and parliament was dissolved shortly afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_8" id="TOPIC_8"></a>The war was going on gloriously under Pitt's direction. Our
ally, Frederick of Prussia, was, indeed, in distress in spite of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
hard-earned victory at Torgau, for his resources were exhausted,
and half his dominions were occupied by his enemies. During
1761 Prince Henry made no progress in Saxony. Frederick
himself lost Schweidnitz, and, with it, half Silesia, while the fall
of Colberg left the Russians free either to besiege Stettin in the
following spring, or to seize on Brandenburg. In Western Germany,
however, where a British army was serving under Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick in the defence of Hanover against the
French, a signal success was gained. Early in the year the
allies entered Hesse, and forced the French to retreat almost
to the Main. Nevertheless they failed to take Cassel, the chief
object of the campaign, and were obliged to retire from Hesse.
In June two French armies, under Marshal de Broglie and Prince
Soubise, effected a junction at Paderborn, advanced to Soest, and
threatened Lippstadt. Ferdinand took up a position between
the Lippe and the Ahse at Vellinghausen. On July 15 he was
attacked by the French. The enemy engaged his left wing, formed
by the British troops under their commander, the gallant Marquis
of Granby. The attack was splendidly met and finally repulsed.
The battle was renewed the next morning at daybreak, and the
allies gained a complete victory. The British troops, who formed
about a fourth part of the allied army, highly distinguished
themselves; Maxwell's grenadiers alone captured four French
battalions. This victory, won against heavy odds, foiled the
most serious attempt of the French against Hanover; it saved
Lippstadt, which would have been exceedingly useful to them
as a dep&ocirc;t; and, more than that, it caused a quarrel between
Broglie and Soubise, which ended in the recall of Broglie, by far
the abler of the two generals. Meanwhile they parted company;
Soubise did much mischief in Westphalia, and Broglie campaigned
to the east of the Weser. The French kept their hold on G&ouml;ttingen
and Cassel, and were therefore in a position to renew their
attacks on Hanover the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAPTURE OF BELLE ILE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_9" id="TOPIC_9"></a>News came from India of the fall of Pondicherry on January
15, 1761, and this was the end of the French power in that land.
Few were the French ships which put out to sea during the year,
and they were all taken. In the West Indies Dominica, one of
the so-called neutral islands, of which the French had taken possession,
was reduced by Lord Rollo, then holding a command in
New York. About the same time the French received a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
galling blow. On March 29 a fleet under the command of Keppel,
carrying a land force of about 9,000 men under General
Hodgson, sailed for Belle Ile, a small and barren island with a
population of 5,000, mostly fisher-folk. It was fortified and well
garrisoned. A first attempt to land was repulsed with nearly
500 casualties. Tidings of the repulse were brought to Pitt; he
sent reinforcements and ordered the commander to persevere. A
second attempt, carried out with remarkable daring, was successful,
and siege was laid to Palais, the strong place of the island. It
was gallantly defended by the governor, who in a night attack
surprised the British in their trenches and inflicted a heavy loss
upon them. The lines which covered the town were taken by
storm and the place was abandoned, but the fortress still held
out. As, however, the British ships cut off all supplies, the
garrison was at last, on June 7, forced to capitulate. They
marched out with the honours of war and were conveyed to
the mainland. By the capture of Belle Ile England gained far
more than the barren island; it was French soil, and France
would be prepared to surrender possessions of greater value
in exchange for it. For Pitt the success of the expedition was
a special triumph, for he had insisted upon it in spite of the
opposition of Newcastle and the adverse opinion of the admirals
Hawke and Boscawen.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_10" id="TOPIC_10"></a>While Pitt was laying down and carrying out plans of victory,
the king and Bute were exciting discord between him and Newcastle.
For a few days after the accession Newcastle seemed
more in favour than Pitt, who was justly displeased because Lord
George Sackville, one of Bute's friends, was received at court in
spite of his recent disgrace. Before long, however, Newcastle
found himself slighted and became violently jealous of Pitt. If
Bute were to ally himself with Pitt and adopt his policy, the old
minister knew that his own day would soon be over. He received
a hint that a change was contemplated. At the end of six months,
Bute said, the king "will declare whom he will call to his cabinet
council".<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The alliance between Pitt and Bute seemed complete.
In January, 1761, the Spanish ambassador wrote: "there is no
better voice in council than his [Pitt's], which joined to that of
my Lord Bute seems to decide matters".<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Pitt could work well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
with the rising star so long as Bute did not oppose the continuance
of the war, for he heartily approved of breaking down
party distinctions, and, like the king, hated government by connexion.
While, however, the king desired to destroy factions
in order to establish personal government, Pitt desired that they
should give place to a system of government by the best men,
supported by the king and the nation. Tories were graciously
received at court, and among them many of Bute's fellow-countrymen.
In November, 1760, six tory lords and grooms of the
bed-chamber were appointed without any intimation having been
given to Newcastle.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The whigs were amazed, and the duke's
mortification was keen.</p>

<p>The king's determination to break down the system which had
so long secured the whig power was set forth and commended
in a remarkable pamphlet written by Douglas, afterwards Bishop
of Salisbury, and probably inspired by his patron, Lord Bath.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
It urged the king to be on his guard against "the pretensions
of a confederacy of ministers," and to exercise the full extent
of power allowed him by the constitution. He must not let his
patronage go by the advice of ministers. Let him rely on his
people; let him be master. Proscription, the writer says, is
ended, and he expresses his belief that if the king will pursue
the line marked out in his pamphlet, corruption also will disappear;
for so long as a minister disposes of places, he has the
means of corrupting parliament, whereas if the crown dispenses
its own patronage it will gain strength, and the independence of
parliament will be restored. For Newcastle, the veteran dispenser
of the royal patronage, such a system meant political extinction.
Its meaning was already brought home to him by an intimation
that he was not to have "the choice of parliament," the management
of the coming general election in boroughs under government
influence, nor to purchase seats with the treasury money. Anson
was reproved by Bute for having, according to custom, provided
members for the admiralty boroughs. Newcastle believed, with
good reason, that Pitt and Bute were agreed on this matter. He
was deeply distressed, and told his friend Hardwicke that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
thought he must resign office.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> That, however, was the last thing
he was likely to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OPPOSING VIEWS WITH RESPECT TO THE WAR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_11" id="TOPIC_11"></a>While Pitt may have welcomed the co-operation of his new
ally from a belief that they had a common policy as regards
government by connexion, and as a means of checking the opposition
with which his plans were often received by Newcastle
and his friends, it is certain from later events that the king and
Bute were not sincere in their dealings with him. They designed
to raise dissension between him and his fellow-ministers,
and so prepare a way for Bute's assumption of office and for the
termination of the war. As early as January 18, 1761, when
Newcastle was sufficiently frightened and humbled, the Sardinian
minister, Count de Viri, one of Bute's tools, had a secret interview
with him, and proposed that the earl should be made a
secretary of state. Newcastle, who was mortally afraid of Pitt,
said that the appointment must be made with his concurrence,
for otherwise Pitt might blame him, and might perhaps resign
office and leave him and Bute saddled with the conduct of
the war.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Bute intended when in office to make a peace which would
immortalise his name. He saw that this would soonest be
obtained if England withdrew from the war on the continent
and confined her operations to the sea. France would then
be induced by the loss of her colonies to make a separate
peace. Pitt was determined not to assent to any peace which
was not made in concert with our allies and did not insure
England a full return for her victories. Bute would have had
the country stand apart from continental politics; Pitt desired
that it should have continental allies and make itself felt in the
politics of Europe. The two opposing views are characteristic
of the two men. Pitt maintained that the continental war was
profitable because it had hindered France from putting forth her
full strength in defence of her colonies. Statesmanlike as his
position was, there was much to be said on the side of the tories
and others, who held that England should confine herself to a
naval war. We have, they argued, no interest in a war for Silesia.
Why should we pay Frederick &pound;670,000 a year, the amount of
the subsidy again granted to him soon after the accession, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
fighting in his own quarrel? What profit do we derive from the
&pound;340,000 paid to the Landgrave of Hesse for the hire of troops?
The naval war has brought a rich return; on the continent we
have nothing to gain by victory. As for the argument that the
German war is one of diversion, why should we divert a war from
the sea, where we are supreme, to land, where we must necessarily
be inferior to France? To fight in Germany for Hanover
is to surrender the advantages of an insular position. Better let
France overrun Hanover, for, as we shall possess her colonies,
we can force her to surrender it again.</p>

<p>These arguments are ably stated in a pamphlet entitled
<i>Considerations on the German War</i>, written by one Israel Mauduit,
and published at the end of 1760. It had a strong effect
on public opinion, and was followed by other pamphlets more or
less on the same lines, and probably written at the instigation of
Bute, for he employed and largely rewarded the services of
pamphleteers. Their arguments were enforced by the growing
expenses of the war and the difficulty of obtaining men
for the army. The supplies granted for the year 1760 were
&pound;15,503,563; for 1761 they amounted to &pound;19,616,119, the interest
on which was to be paid by the continuance of the old
taxes and a new tax of three shillings per barrel on beer and ale.
The national debt of Great Britain and Ireland, which in 1755
was &pound;72,505,572, entailing a charge for interest and expenses
of a little over &pound;2,500,000, amounted in 1760 to &pound;102,000,000,
with a charge of &pound;3,500,000.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In 1761 the British troops serving
abroad were thirty-nine regiments of foot and thirty-one of horse
and dragoons; in all, 110,000 men, besides 60,000 German
auxiliaries in British pay. In Germany we had about 25,000
men. At the same time sea-pay was drawn for 288 ships of
various kinds and 80,675 men, the navy then consisting of 378
vessels, of which 285 were first to sixth rates.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Of these, 121
ships of the line with about 70,000 men were in active service.
The call for men was very heavy in proportion to the population,
and high bounties were offered for enlistment. Balloting for
the new militia caused some riots in the north, specially at Hexham,
where the miners fiercely attacked the militia, and forty-two
men were killed and forty-eight wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A GENERAL ELECTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_12" id="TOPIC_12"></a>Before the king and Bute opened their campaign they insured
support in parliament. Early in 1761 preparations were
made for the general election. The court spread the idea that
it was for purity of election; it was known that Newcastle's
hands were tied, and it was expected that no money would be
issued from the treasury. Nothing was less true. Corruption
was rampant and the treasury issued large sums. George personally
named candidates for boroughs belonging to the crown,
to which the ministry had hitherto appointed, and otherwise
took an active share in the arrangements. For the most part he
worked through Bute, to whom Newcastle was forced to submit
his lists of candidates that he might compare them with his own
and decide who should be brought in. This was galling to the
old minister, but he had already done much to forward the whig
interest in the coming election, and flattered himself that "they
[the court] had left matters too late for them to do any mischief".<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
In former elections the whigs used the resources of the crown
to secure power for themselves; in this election the crown itself
used its own means of corrupt influence. Private men followed
its example. A new class of candidates appeared, men without
party connexion or local interest, who had lately become rich,
West India merchants, "nabobs" gorged with the spoils of the
East, shareholders of the East India Company, admirals and
others who had reaped a splendid harvest from the destruction
of the commerce and shipping of France. The competition for
seats was extraordinary; at Andover there were nine candidates.
Constituencies which had long obeyed the orders of great landlords
were no longer to be reckoned upon. No political question
was exciting public interest, and the borough elections were decided
rather by money than by measures. Bribery was carried
to a preposterous height, and the new-rich bought seats as
openly as they bought their horses. The borough of Sudbury
went so far as to advertise itself for sale. Those who without
political aims or connexions forced themselves into parliament
by their wealth were peculiarly open to court influence. Newcastle's
belief that the elections would secure his position was
ill-founded; many members on whom he relied were ready to
desert him at the bidding of the court. By the beginning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
March, before the elections were over, the king and Bute were
sure of the support they desired.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_13" id="TOPIC_13"></a>Bute was in a position which enabled him to take office and
to begin to carry out the designs cherished by his master and
himself, to bring the war to an end and to encourage the jealousy
of Pitt's colleagues to such an extent that they would force him
to leave them. He could be dispensed with as soon as peace
was made, and without him the whig ranks could easily be
broken up, for Newcastle could be crushed at any time. With
Bute as an ally Pitt dominated over his fellow-ministers, who
bore his yoke with rebellious feelings. If Bute came over to
their side they could make a stand against him. Viri's secret
negotiations on Bute's behalf gave them a chance not to be
neglected. Newcastle, Hardwicke, and the Duke of Devonshire
took counsel together, and Newcastle went to the king with a
proposal that Bute should accept office. To this George, of
course, readily assented. Pitt knew nothing of all this until the
matter was settled.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> On March 12 Holdernesse was dismissed.
It was not a creditable business; four months before he had
signified his readiness to make room for Bute,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and he received
a present pension of &pound;4,000 a year and the reversion of the
wardenship of the Cinque Ports, which was at least equally
valuable, as a reward for his complaisance. He was succeeded
by Bute as secretary of state on the 25th.</p>

<p>At the same time Legge, the chancellor of the exchequer,
who had refused to accede to Bute's wishes with regard to two
elections, and was much disliked by the king,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was dismissed,
and was succeeded by Lord Barrington, an honest man, with
no strong political convictions, who was always ready to carry
out the king's plans. Barrington was succeeded as secretary-at-war
by Charles Townshend, a brilliant wit and orator, "the
delight and ornament" of the house of commons,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> a reckless
and unstable politician, who was destined to bring evil on his
country. A month earlier, one of Bute's adherents, George
Grenville, the treasurer of the navy, a brother of Earl Temple,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
lord privy seal, and a brother-in-law of Pitt, was rewarded
by a seat in the cabinet. He had considerable ability, great
aptitude for business, and a thorough knowledge of parliamentary
affairs, was a statesman of unsullied purity, public-spirited,
hard-working and ambitious;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he was deficient in
tact, had no generosity of mind, and was harsh, formal, and
impatient of opposition. Newcastle's perfidy increased the ill-feeling
between him and Pitt, against whom the new alliance
was avowedly directed,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> for at the time that Newcastle sold
himself to Bute in order to gain his support, Pitt was becoming
aware that the king was probably about to oppose his policy
with respect to the war. Newcastle was delighted with the
success of his trick, but he soon found that Bute slighted him,
and that his power was going from him, for he was no longer
allowed to control the patronage of the crown.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> By treating
him in this way the king and Bute kept him subservient. Bute
aggravated the division between the ministers, and used Pitt's
colleagues against him in the conflict which was impending on
the question of peace and war. The history of that conflict is
for convenience' sake deferred to the next chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S MARRIAGE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_14" id="TOPIC_14"></a>The satisfaction caused by the young king's gracious manners
and respectable life was increased by his marriage. In 1755
his grandfather had proposed that he should marry a princess
of the house of Brunswick, but abandoned the project in consequence
of the opposition of George's mother. About a year
before his accession George fell in love with Lady Sarah Lennox,
a daughter of the late Duke of Richmond and sister-in-law of
Henry Fox, a young lady of remarkable beauty. His attentions
to her were continued after his accession. Fox and his wife,
Lady Caroline, took care that he should have every opportunity
of seeing her; and George, as he rode through Kensington, was
charmed to find her in a fancy dress playing at hay-making in
front of Fox's residence, Holland House. He went so far as
to signify plainly to her that he meant to make her a formal
offer of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Most inopportunely Lady Sarah broke her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
leg, and while she was laid up, the princess-dowager and Bute
persuaded George to change his mind. They at once arranged
a marriage for him with the Princess Charlotte, a daughter of
the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the marriage took place
on September 8. The queen did not meddle in affairs of state;
she bore fifteen children, and had many domestic virtues. On
the 22nd the king and queen were crowned.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_15" id="TOPIC_15"></a>George's popularity was impaired by the influence exercised
over him by his mother and Bute, which excited the ridicule of
the higher class of society and the bitter feelings of the London
populace. Bystanders sneered when they saw him on his way
to visit his mother, and it is said that on one occasion he was
insulted with a coarse jest. In Bute's case the idea that he was
the royal favourite would alone have sufficed to make him hated.
The term was generally applied to him. Yet he was not a
favourite in the more odious sense of the word, for though the
king showed him signal favour, their relations were rather political
than personal. His nationality strengthened the dislike with
which he was regarded. The jacobite troubles had increased
the prejudices of the English against the Scots; they looked
down upon them as a half-barbarous people, poor, and greedy
to enrich themselves with the wealth of England. Scorn and
indignation were aroused by the grants of honours and employments
made to Bute's Scottish followers who came in
great numbers to the court under his patronage. Bills were
posted in London with the words: "No petticoat government!
No Scotch minister! No Lord George Sackville!" Any unpopular
measure was set down to Bute's advice. The beer-tax
was believed to have been suggested by him, and provoked a
disturbance in the theatre in the king's presence, which caused
Bute much annoyance. He was yet to rise higher in the state,
and to arouse more violent feelings of hatred and contempt.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>THE PEACE OF PARIS.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_16" id="TOPIC_16"></a>By the beginning of 1761 France was anxious for peace, and
in concert with her allies, Austria, Russia, Sweden, and Poland,
invited Great Britain and Prussia to negotiate, and suggested
that a congress should meet at Augsburg. England and Prussia
assented, and plenipotentiaries were appointed. In England the
prospect of a peace was hailed with satisfaction, and the funds
rose 4 per cent. The congress never met, but the plan was not
abandoned for some months; and Choiseul, the minister of Louis
XV., sent a memorial to England proposing that, as difficulties
would arise at the congress if the questions in dispute between
England and France were debated along with the affairs of
their respective allies, the two courts should enter on a separate
negotiation. He offered to treat on the basis of <i>uti possidetis</i>,
that is, that the possessions of both countries should be acknowledged
as regards the conquests made by the one from the other,
and that certain dates in the current year should be fixed upon
as those on which the conquests should be ascertained. The
offer was large; for at that time England had conquered from
France Cape Breton, Canada, Guadeloupe, Mariegalante, Goree,
and Senegal, and had also gained great advantages in India,
though the fall of Pondicherry was not yet known; while
France had only conquered Minorca from England. She had
also, it will be remembered, gained insecure possession of
Hesse, Hanau, and G&ouml;ttingen. England agreed to a separate
negotiation on the basis of <i>uti possidetis</i>, but Pitt would not
commit himself as to the dates, for he was preparing the expedition
against Belle Ile, and intended that England should not
lose the advantage which would accrue from its success. He also
declared that his court would not desert the King of Prussia.
Choiseul replied that neither would France desert her allies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and that the negotiation only concerned the interests of the two
powers. On this understanding the two courts sent representatives
the one to the other; the English representative chosen by
Pitt was Hans Stanley, and M. de Bussy was sent to London
by Choiseul.</p>

<p>Soon after they arrived at their destinations Belle Ile was
conquered. Pitt knew how deeply the national spirit of France
would be wounded by this blow; he promised to restore the
island if adequate compensation were made, and Choiseul professed
himself willing to make important concessions. On July
15, however, he made proposals of a less favourable kind than
might have been expected. They were, briefly, that France
should cede Canada on certain conditions, one of which was that
she should have liberty to fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
dry cod on the Newfoundland shore, and should have Cape
Breton in sovereignty for a shelter for her ships, though she
should not erect fortifications. She would restore Minorca, and
should receive back Guadeloupe and Mariegalante; two of the
neutral islands, Dominica and St. Vincent, should be under her
protection, and of the other two she should keep St. Lucia and
England should have Tobago. The rival claims in India were
to be settled on the basis of a treaty of 1755, before the late
English victories. England should restore either Senegal or
Goree, for unless France had one of them, her West India possessions
would be useless, as she would have no port for the
shipment of negroes. Belle Ile was to be restored, and France
would evacuate Hesse and Hanau. After preliminaries were
signed England was not to help Prussia, nor France Austria, but
France would not surrender the territories conquered from the
King of Prussia, for they were conquered and held in the name
of the Empress-queen. This stipulation was made in favour of
Austria which had assented to the separate negotiation on condition
that her interests were guarded. The proposals were of
a kind to suggest doubts as to Choiseul's sincerity. As a matter
of fact he was secretly arranging a strict alliance with Spain as
a means of forcing England to make favourable terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SPANISH AND FRENCH MEMORIALS.</i></div>

<p>Spain had three grievances against Great Britain. She complained
that her ships had wrongfully been made prizes, that she
was shut out from the Newfoundland fishery, and that British
settlements had been made on the bay of Honduras. Charles III,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of Spain had a strong leaning towards a French alliance; he
was much influenced by the family tie between himself and the
other Bourbon powers, and he considered that the destruction of
the French navy by Great Britain deprived Spain of a guarantee
for the safety of her possessions in the western hemisphere. He
believed that by identifying the interests of Spain with those of
France, he would gain a satisfactory settlement of his own claims
and also better terms for France than she could otherwise obtain.
As early as September, 1760, the Count de Fuentes, the
Spanish minister in London, presented to Pitt a memorial on the
Newfoundland fishery, in which it was stated that a copy had
been communicated to the court of France. Indignant at the
implied threat, Pitt replied that he was at a loss to understand
the meaning of such a communication, and that France had
nothing to do with the question.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> A month later Dutens,
secretary to the British embassy at Turin, sent him information
which proved that the King of Spain would not long remain a
passive spectator of the war.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Pitt was thus fully aware of the
necessity for watchfulness as to the relations between France and
Spain; the correspondence between Fuentes and the Marquis
Grimaldi, the Spanish minister at Paris, was regularly intercepted
and its contents communicated by Pitt to his colleagues. The
two ambassadors were endeavouring to bring about an alliance
between their king and Louis, and, on March 10, 1761, Fuentes
wrote that "if this is done, at the end of the year we shall have
a peace to our liking and France's," and that England would be
compelled by "force and fear" to do justice to Spain. Pitt
soon showed him and Choiseul how unsafe it was to reckon on
English fear.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_17" id="TOPIC_17"></a>Along with the French proposals of July 15, Bussy presented
Pitt with a memorial on the grievances of Spain, proposing that
England should terminate her differences with that court, and
declaring that the French king "cannot disguise the danger he
apprehends, and of which he must necessarily partake if these
objects which seem nearly to concern his Catholic majesty shall
be the occasion of a war". Pitt was furious at this insult to his
country and at once addressed Bussy in terms different from the
ordinary language of diplomacy. He declared in plain words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
that the king would not allow the dispute with Spain to be
blended in any manner whatever in the negotiation, and that
any further attempt to blend them would be considered an
affront. He returned the memorial as "wholly inadmissible".<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
In answer to the French articles he replied that Canada must
be ceded unconditionally, and refused to surrender Cape Breton
or to allow France any part in the fisheries. Both Pitt and
Choiseul held the fisheries question to be of prime importance.
If France were shut out from them, she would, Pitt believed,
permanently be crippled as a maritime power, for apart from
the value of the fish both for victualling ships and in commerce
the fisheries were a nursery for a race of hardy seamen, and
Pitt wished to prevent France from ever restoring either her
merchant marine or her naval strength. The second crucial
question in the negotiation concerned our allies. Pitt insisted
that Frederick should receive back the territories conquered
from him by France, and that both England and France should
be free to help their allies. Determined to give France no
commercial advantage, he refused to cede either Senegal or
Goree. England must have Minorca, but would agree to an
equal partition of the neutral islands, and would restore Belle Ile,
Guadeloupe, and Mariegalante. He further rejected the date
proposed as a basis for a peace in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S ULTIMATUM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_18" id="TOPIC_18"></a>Pitt kept the negotiation with Bussy in his own hands,
and met opposition in the cabinet with haughty determination.
Newcastle and his party were eager for peace, and, equally with
Bussy, complained that the tone of his despatches was too
peremptory. Bute resented what he described as Pitt's insolence.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Nevertheless the king and he considered the French
proposals unsatisfactory and were annoyed by the memorial concerning
the Spanish grievances, but Bute believed that patient
negotiation would induce France to yield all that was in dispute.
Accordingly, to Newcastle's consternation, he supported Pitt's
demands. Pitt's strongest opponent was the Duke of Bedford,
who was urgently summoned to the council by Bute and Newcastle
when they wanted a champion against him. Upright
and fairly able, Bedford owed his political prominence mainly
to his rank and vast wealth; he was much addicted to sport and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
other pleasures, and allowed himself to be guided by a gang of
greedy adherents of whom Rigby, a coarse and shameless place-hunter,
was the chief. Pitt laid his ultimatum to France before
the council on August 15. He had so far yielded to pressure
as to offer France a limited right of fishing, and the island of
St. Pierre as a shelter and port, provided it was kept unfortified.
On the other crucial question his demand was unchanged; the
Westphalian lands were to be restored to Frederick, and both
parties were to remain free to help their allies. His despatch
was considered needlessly irritating, but he would not allow a
word to be altered. Bute would give no help against him.
Bedford, who had a violent temper, was so angry at being overborne,
that he declared that he would attend no more councils,
and Newcastle was reduced to whining despair. By the 18th,
however, Bute came to an agreement with the Newcastle faction
and promised to help them against Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Lord Bristol, our ambassador at Madrid, was instructed
to remonstrate energetically with General Wall, the Spanish
minister, on the subject of Bussy's memorial. He was to say
that as regards the prizes there were courts whose business it
was to decide such matters, that England would not allow Spain
any share in the fishery, but was willing to receive representations
as to the Honduras settlements, provided they were not
sent through France, and that any union of counsels with France
would hinder an amicable arrangement. He was, further, to
demand an explanation of the naval preparations which Spain
was making. He could obtain no satisfaction, and on August
31 sent Pitt a paper in which Wall declared that his master
concurred in Bussy's memorial, and, while he protested that no
offence was intended, maintained that Spain and France had a
right to mix in the affairs each of the other "for mutual assistance".
A declaration of war from Spain was, Bristol thought,
not far off.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> On September 2 Stanley sent Pitt a copy of what
he believed to be an article of a secret treaty between France
and Spain, and wrote that he was assured in Paris that Spain
would immediately declare war, and that a treaty between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
two powers only needed signature.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Intercepted letters between
Fuentes and Grimaldi proved that a treaty had been signed
between them on August 15. This was the famous family
compact, the purport of which was not yet known in England.
A fresh set of proposals was made by Choiseul, and Stanley
was led to believe one day that peace was unlikely, and another
that France would agree to terms and that "the affair of Spain
would be dropped".<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It became evident that Choiseul was
trifling with England, and on September 15 the cabinet decided
to recall Stanley forthwith.</p>

<p>Choiseul was anxious to avoid an immediate breach between
England and Spain, both because Spain was expecting the
arrival of her treasure-ships from America,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and also because
her naval preparations were incomplete. Pitt, who was convinced
that Spain was intending to declare war, was anxious to
strike while so grand an opportunity lasted. A cabinet council
was held on the 19th. He was not present, but sent in a paper
signed by himself and Temple, urging that, in view of Wall's
avowal of "a total union of counsels and interests" between
the two Bourbon monarchies, Bristol should be ordered to
return to England without taking leave, in fact, that war
with Spain should at once be declared.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Unfortunately we
had no <i>casus belli</i> against Spain, and could not found one
on secret information. The council made a point of this,
and voted that a declaration of war would neither be just nor
expedient, but that Bristol should demand further and distinct
assurances of the intentions of Spain. They knew that their
decision would probably lead to Pitt's resignation, and held
anxious discussion, for they were in great perplexity. Bute had
hoped that peace would be made, and then Pitt might be got
rid of. Things were turning out awkwardly. "If," he said, "we
had any view of peace, he should be less solicitous what part Mr.
Pitt took, but that, as the continuance of the war seemed unavoidable,
he thought that we should do what we could to
hinder Mr. Pitt from going out, and thereby leaving the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>practicability
of his own war upon us."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He and the rest of the
council knew that Pitt could conduct the war, and that they could
not. They agreed that peace with France might still be hoped for.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT AND HIS COLLEAGUES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_19" id="TOPIC_19"></a>That belief was strongly held by the king, and he was delighted
by a letter from Stanley holding out hope of peace.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
George believed Choiseul's assurances, and was angry with Pitt
for treating them as mere amusements. At a council on the
21st, Pitt, in an eloquent speech, pointed out "the almost certainty"
of success against the united forces of the Bourbon
monarchies, but, said he, "there is not an hour to lose". He
regretted the concessions which he had been persuaded to make
to France, and "was determined <i>now</i> to abide by his own
opinion". The council adhered to its decision of the 19th. It
was plain that Pitt and Temple would retire, and their colleagues
discussed who should succeed Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> George's spirits
were dashed by another letter from Stanley expressing his
belief that Spain was contemplating an attack on our ally the
King of Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> He could not conceal his ill-temper, and let
it be known that he wished to get rid of Pitt "in all events".<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
He was soon gratified. Another cabinet meeting was held on
October 2 to decide what orders should be sent to Bristol. Pitt
took the same ground as before, and declared that his opinion
had been strengthened by one of Grimaldi's intercepted letters.
Granville, the president of the council, said that he was convinced
that a declaration of war with Spain would neither be
just nor expedient. Newcastle, Devonshire, and Hardwicke
concurred. Bute said that such a war would be dangerous,
and in any case should be put off as long as possible. Anson
thought that our ships were not in a condition for it.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Mansfield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
feared that if England declared war against Spain the other
maritime powers would think that she was set on destroying
them all. Ligonier believed that Spain could put 70,000 men
in the field; she had made "a great figure" in Queen Anne's
reign, and might do so again, and she would be joined by
Naples with an army of 20,000. Temple spoke on Pitt's side,
and then appears to have left the council-room in anger.</p>

<p>Pitt spoke again. He had, he said, "been called by the
sovereign, and in some degree by the voice of the people, to
assist the state when others had abdicated". He had succeeded
in spite of opposition, for hardly an expedition he had proposed,
"though most probable and attended with the greatest success,
had not beforehand been treated as chimerical and ridiculous".
He knew the little interest he had either in council or parliament,
but, said he, "the papers which I have in my bag" (meaning
a letter from Bristol, and the paper which he sent from
Wall) "fix an eternal stain on the crown of England, if proper
measures are not taken upon them"; and he would not acquiesce
in sending no answer to Spain. He was responsible, and he
"would not continue without having the direction". No one
could be surprised at his going on no longer, for he would be
responsible for nothing but what he directed. Granville spoke
some words of compliment to him, but protested against his
claim to direct; when the king referred a matter to the council
"the opinion of the majority must decide". The council rejected
Pitt's proposal.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT RESIGNS OFFICE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_20" id="TOPIC_20"></a>It must not be supposed that Pitt had information as to the
relations between France and Spain which he did not lay before
his colleagues; indeed it is fairly certain that this was not the
case. They knew that a treaty was made, and that Spain had
entered into it with hostile intentions. Pitt, with the insight
of a statesman, was sure that war with Spain was certain, and
desired to strike before she was ready. His colleagues, anxious
for peace and fretting under his predominance, allowed themselves
to be blinded by their hopes. They believed that France
might yet shake off her engagement to Spain, and be willing to
make peace on terms to which Great Britain could agree; and
they determined in any case to put off a declaration of war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
against Spain as long as possible. Pitt resigned the seals on
the 5th. So ended the ministry of that great man who alone,
at a critical time, had justly rated the strength and spirit of
England, and had dared to rely upon them, who had taught
his fellow-countrymen how great things they might do, had
sent them forth, confident in that knowledge, to victory after
victory, and had laid broad and deep the foundations of Britain's
colonial empire.</p>

<p>The king's petulant wish was fulfilled, but though he and
Bute approved of the decision of the council, Bute thought
that Pitt's resignation was "not favourable in the present minute
to the king's affairs". He would have been well pleased if
George could have found in Pitt a minister subservient to his
royal will; he could not endure that he should give strength
to a whig cabinet. Pitt took a line which the king disliked,
yet Bute knew that he could ill be spared so long as the war
lasted, and was annoyed that his intrigues against him had been
successful at an inopportune time. The leaders of the whig
oligarchy, and specially Newcastle, Devonshire, and Bedford,
sometimes inspired by Bute, and sometimes urging him on,
had succeeded in driving Pitt out of office. What was to be
their reward? They were to fall back into disunion, and were
consequently to find themselves unable to resist the growth of
the royal power. As for Pitt himself, his resignation dissolved
the unnatural alliance between him and them. His position
was tolerable only so long as he was their master, for in feeling
he was not one of them. As heartily as George himself he
hated government by connexion, and like him desired to break
up all parties. He despised the corrupt practices by which
the whigs strengthened themselves, and he had a deep reverence
for the crown. Yet his aims were totally different from those
of the king. He would have broken party ties in order to form
a strong administration; he would have destroyed corruption
and looked to the king and nation for the support of government,
and relying on their support would have crushed the
enemies of England. George, on the other hand, wanted
ministers who would carry out his will; he was led to imitate
and, indeed, to surpass the whigs in corrupt practices; he desired
that England should be at peace, and should take no part in
continental politics. Pitt at last stood alone and unconnected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Which would gain his support, the king or the whigs? The
question runs through the history of the party politics of England
during the next eight years.</p>

<p>When Pitt went to the king to give up the seals of his
office, George spoke graciously to him. Always intoxicated
by a peep into the royal closet, Pitt burst into tears and replied
in words of absurd self-abasement. The tidings of his resignation
were received with general indignation. For a moment his
popularity was overclouded. He accepted a pension of &pound;3,000
a year for three lives, and the dignity of Baroness of Chatham
for his wife. With mean and studied<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> adroitness it was contrived
that the <i>Gazette</i> announcing his resignation should publish
with it a notification of these grants, and a letter from
Stanley again holding out hope of a peace with France. For
the grants it is, as Burke wrote, "a shame that any defence
should be necessary".<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Pitt addressed a dignified letter to alderman
Beckford, his chief follower in the city, on the cause of
his resignation and the "unsolicited" marks of royal favour
which he had received. His popularity rose as high as ever.
The city was specially strong for him, for its merchants and
traders owed him a deep debt of gratitude. At the lord mayor's
feast on November 9, which was attended by the king, he
had the bad taste to draw off the cheers in the street to himself;
he was loudly applauded, and the king coldly received.
Bute's coach was escorted by hired bruisers; it was attacked
amid cries of "Damn all Scotch rogues!" "No Bute!" "No
Newcastle salmon!" and Bute was rescued from the mob by
constables. In parliament Pitt adopted a noble line; he justified
his own conduct without blaming his late colleagues, disregarded
attacks upon himself, and urged the ministers to act firmly, and
the house to give them its united support.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAR DECLARED AGAINST SPAIN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_21" id="TOPIC_21"></a>He was succeeded as secretary of state by Lord Egremont,
a man of small ability; the leadership of the commons was
committed to Grenville, and Bedford took Temple's place as
privy seal. Events soon vindicated the wisdom of Pitt's demand
for instant war with Spain. Bristol in vain demanded satisfactory
assurances from that court. At first Wall's answers
were conciliatory, but naval preparations still went on. By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
November 2 all the treasure-ships had arrived safely. Their
arrival caused a marked change in Wall's tone; he no longer
disguised the hostile feeling of his court. At Christmas the
Family Compact was published. It was of the same character
as the compacts of 1733 and 1743, and arranged a strict
alliance between the sovereigns of the house of Bourbon. It
was formed between the Kings of France and Spain, the King
of Spain also engaging for the King of the Two Sicilies, and it
guaranteed the dominions of the three kings and of the Duke
of Parma. Each sovereign was to send specified assistance to
any of the others who might require it, but wars undertaken by
France in consequence of engagements to German or northern
states were not to be cases in which Spain should be bound to
send help, "unless some maritime power should take part in
them". These words pointed directly to Great Britain. On
January 2, 1762, war was declared against Spain. France and
Spain forced our ally, the King of Portugal, to declare war, and
in the spring Spain invaded his kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_22" id="TOPIC_22"></a>This new war afforded Bedford an opportunity for moving
in parliament for the recall of the British troops from Germany.
Bute, though equally desirous for their recall, opposed the motion
as inopportune; circumstances, he said, had arisen which
promised to enable us to lessen expenses and reduce the war.
The motion was lost. The declaration of disagreement between
two cabinet ministers on so serious a question illustrates the
difference between the cabinet system of the time and that of
to-day. The circumstances to which Bute referred were the
death of Frederick's enemy, Elizabeth of Russia, on January 5,
and the accession of Peter III., who was his ardent admirer.
Peter restored East Prussia to Frederick, ordered Tchernitchev
and his 20,000 men to withdraw from Glatz, and entered into
negotiations for an alliance with Prussia, which was concluded
later. Frederick's position was totally changed. Bute hoped
that he would use this change of fortune to make peace; it
naturally caused him to be more eager to prosecute the war
for Silesia. When he applied for the renewal of the English
subsidy of &pound;670,000, Bute informed him that it would only be
granted on condition that he gave assurances that he was ready
to make peace. This Frederick would not do. Other difficulties
arose between the two courts. Bute complained that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Frederick was secretly negotiating with Russia for a separate
treaty which would hinder a general peace, and thwart our
policy in the north by encouraging Russia to enforce the surrender
of Schleswig. Frederick also had his complaints. Early
in the year Bute made certain efforts for a general peace, and
Frederick asserted that Bute had suggested that Russia should
force him to surrender Silesia to Austria. Bute was deceived
as regards the tsar's intentions, and his words were spoken
in the interest of Prussia. Nevertheless, Frederick would not be
pacified, and he further accused Bute of trying to dissuade Peter
from making an alliance with him. This charge was flatly
denied by Bute. It rests solely on the assertion of Prince
Galitzin, the Russian ambassador in London, and there is no
reason for doubting Bute's word.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> As Frederick refused to give
any pledge as to the terms on which he would make peace, the
British government refused the subsidy.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_23" id="TOPIC_23"></a>Pitt having been driven from office, the king and Bute
turned upon Newcastle. Bute and Grenville treated him with
discourtesy; he found himself deprived of the power of dispensing
patronage; the king did not even consult him as to
the new peerages granted in the spring. As an old whig he
set a high value on the continental connexion formed by the
alliance with Frederick, and cared more for the war in Europe
than for naval expeditions. He was deeply annoyed by the
desire of Bute, Grenville, and Bedford to withdraw our troops
from Germany and by the refusal of the subsidy. He would
not, he declared, "be Grenville's tool and load the nation with
four or five millions to carry on a ridiculous, destructive
maritime war".<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Nevertheless he clung to office. Devonshire
and Hardwicke agreed with him, and attached themselves to a
section of the whigs who acknowledged the Duke of Cumberland
as their head. Newcastle proposed that a vote of
&pound;2,000,000 should be asked for, &pound;1,000,000 as usual for the
German war and &pound;1,000,000 for the war in Portugal. Bute and
Grenville maintained that only &pound;1,000,000 was wanted. That,
he said, implied the abandonment of the German war. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
question was decided against him in a cabinet meeting on May 4.
Bitterly as he felt this defeat on a matter concerning his own
office, the treasury, he would not do more than threaten to
resign, and found an excuse for retaining office for the present.
George and Bute were determined that he should go; George
was ungracious, Bute uncivil. His friends urged him to resign.
At last he brought himself to the point and resigned on the 25th.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BUTE'S ADMINISTRATION.</i></div>

<p>On his resignation the king spoke kindly to the old man, as
indeed he well might, for the duke had spent a long life and a
vast fortune in the service of his house; he had, it is said, reduced
his income from &pound;25,000 to &pound;6,000 a year in securing
support for government by means which, whatever we may
esteem them now, were then considered becoming to a man of
his wealth and station. George pressed him to accept a pension.
He refused, declaring that the gracious sense which the
king expressed of the sacrifices he had made for his royal house
was all the recompense he desired.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> If Pitt's acceptance of
rewards needs no defence, Newcastle's refusal of them demands
admiration. Bute succeeded him as first lord of the treasury.
Several other changes were made in the administration. George
Grenville became secretary of state in Bute's place, and Sir
Francis Dashwood chancellor of the exchequer in succession to
Barrington, who took Grenville's office as treasurer of the navy.
Dashwood was utterly ignorant of the rudiments of finance, and
was scandalously immoral; his house, Medmenham abbey, was
the meeting-place of the Hell-fire club, of which he was the
founder, and he took a foremost part in the childish mummery,
the debauchery, and blasphemy of the "Franciscans," as his
companions called themselves. Lord Halifax, a man of popular
manners, loose morals, and small ability, succeeded Anson at the
admiralty; Henley remained lord chancellor, Bedford privy seal,
and Fox paymaster. Devonshire had ceased to attend meetings
of the cabinet but was still lord chamberlain. The king
and Bute had won a signal success; the whig administration
was broken up and Bute was virtually master of the government.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_24" id="TOPIC_24"></a>The Russian alliance more than made up to Frederick for the
loss of the English subsidy; Tchernitchev and his army were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
at his disposal. Suddenly his hopes were clouded over. On
July 10 Peter was deposed and soon afterwards was murdered.
He was succeeded by his wife Catherine, who did not share his
admiration for the Prussian king. Frederick was facing the
Austrians in Silesia when orders came to Tchernitchev to lead
his army home. Tchernitchev delayed his departure, remaining
merely as an onlooker, to give the Prussians the support of his
presence. On the 21st Frederick won the decisive battle of
Burkersdorf, and a few weeks later was master of Silesia. In
western Germany, where the war more immediately concerned
England, Prince Ferdinand showed consummate skill in forcing
the French to act on the defensive. On June 24 the allies
defeated them at Wilhelmsthal. The victory was decided by
Granby, who, after a fierce engagement, destroyed the pick of the
French army under Stainville. A series of successes followed;
G&ouml;ttingen was evacuated, the larger part of Hesse reconquered,
and Cassel and some other places which remained to the French
were blockaded. The French army of reserve under Cond&eacute;
marched from the Lower Rhine to help Soubise; a junction was
effected to the north of Frankfort, and the French attempted to
open up communications with Cassel. After much man&oelig;uvring
about the Lahn, no way seemed possible for them save
by crossing the Ohm. The passage at Br&uuml;ckenm&uuml;hle, near
Am&ouml;neburg, was held by the allies. The French attacked on
September 21. During the last four hours of the conflict, which
lasted the whole day, the defence was taken up by Granby, and
was maintained with splendid determination until at last the
French retired. Cassel surrendered on November 1, and the
war ended.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BRITISH SUCCESSES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_25" id="TOPIC_25"></a>Success attended the arms of Great Britain in other quarters.
Pitt's spirit still animated her efforts. How far the government
adopted his plans and arrangements cannot, perhaps, be decided
with certainty. He had large ideas, which probably included
not merely the conquest of Martinique and Havana, but also
an attack on Louisiana. The enemies of the government attributed
to him the victories which followed his resignation.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The ministers naturally claimed the credit of them and certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
made arrangements for them,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> probably following lines already
marked out by Pitt. Rodney, who was in command on the
Leeward islands station, acting in co-operation with General
Monckton, reduced Martinique in February. The fall of that
island, the seat of the government of France in the West Indies,
the centre of her privateering expeditions, and her chief mart in
those parts, was followed by the surrender of Grenada, St. Lucia,
and St. Vincent, and England became mistress of all the Windward
islands. Against these losses France could set only a
momentary possession of St. John's, Newfoundland, which was
speedily retaken. Spain had to pay heavily for her rashness in
espousing the French cause. Her troops, indeed, entered Portugal,
overran Traz-os-Montes, and threatened Oporto, while
south of the Douro they advanced as far as Almeida and took
it. But the aspect of affairs changed when 8,000 British soldiers
landed at Lisbon and the Count of Lippe-B&uuml;ckeburg took
the command. He was ably seconded by General Burgoyne,
and the Spaniards were forced to retreat within their own
frontier.</p>

<p>So far as England was concerned the war in Portugal was a
small matter. It was through her power on the sea that she was
able to reap a rich harvest from her war with Spain. In March
a fleet under Pocock, carrying 10,000 men under the command
of the Earl of Albemarle, sailed for Havana. Off Cape St.
Nicholas, Pocock was joined by a reinforcement sent by Rodney.
There was no time to lose, for the hurricane season was near;
and he therefore took his ships through the shoals of the Bahama
channel instead of to the south of Cuba, and brought them out
safely on June 5, a notable piece of seamanship, for the channel
was little known. The troops laid siege to Fort Moro, which
commanded Havana. The Spaniards made a vigorous defence,
and the British suffered terribly from disease; at one time 5,000
soldiers and 3,000 seamen were incapacitated by sickness.
Much-needed reinforcements arrived from New York, and, on
July 30, the fort was taken by storm after a siege of forty-five
days. The town capitulated on August 12. The reduction of
the island deprived Spain of a rich colony, an important centre
of trade, and, more, of a port which commanded the route of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
treasure-ships from the Gulf of Mexico. An immense booty
was secured, &pound;3,000,000 in money besides merchandise.</p>

<p>About the same time England dealt Spain a heavy blow on
the other side of the world. An expedition under General
Draper sailed from Madras in a fleet commanded by Admiral
Cornish, and on September 25 landed at Manila. The Spaniards,
though unprepared, refused to surrender, and the place was
taken by storm. Large government stores were seized by the
victors, but the British commanders allowed the inhabitants to
ransom their property for 4,000,000 dollars. Half this sum was
paid in bills on the Spanish treasury which were rejected at
Madrid, and the money was never paid. With Manila the whole
of the Philippines passed to Great Britain. Though a privateering
expedition undertaken with the Portuguese against Buenos
Ayres was beaten off with heavy loss, Spain was unable to
defend the sources of her wealth against the British navy. In
May the capture of the <i>Hermione</i>, from Lima, brought over
&pound;500,000 to the captains and crews of the frigate and sloop
engaged in the business. A glorious procession passed through
London, carrying the treasure to the Tower, on August 12, when
people were rejoicing at an event scarcely to be remembered
with equal satisfaction, the birth of the future king, George IV.
Two of the ships belonging to the Manila expedition also made
a prize of an Acapulco ship with a cargo worth 3,000,000 dollars.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_26" id="TOPIC_26"></a>During the summer Bute treated with France through the
Count de Viri. Bedford urged concessions upon him, and his
fear lest the negotiations should be broken off made him willing
to agree to Choiseul's demands. He would, indeed, have yielded
more than he did, if Grenville had not checked him in the
cabinet. In September Bedford was sent to Paris to settle the
preliminaries. Peace was by no means desired by the English
people; they were proud of their victories and were disgusted
that Bute should have the management of affairs. Bedford was
hooted in the streets of London as he set out for Paris. Both
Bute and his enemies prepared for a struggle. Bute, as usual,
employed the press to fight for him, and engaged the services of
a number of pamphleteers and newspaper-writers. His character
as a patron of men of letters rests chiefly on the money which
he spent in this way, though it must be set to his credit that he
procured a pension for Samuel Johnson without stipulating for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
any return. Among his hired scribes was Smollett, who edited
a paper for him called <i>The Briton</i>. The other side, too, was
active. In obedience to Frederick's instructions the Prussian
ambassadors took part in exciting popular discontent with the
government; and were justly reproved by Grenville for their
preposterous conduct. Bute was vigorously assailed in print.
The publication of <i>The Briton</i> called forth the ironically named
<i>North Briton</i>, of which the first number appeared in June.
It was brought out by John Wilkes, member for Aylesbury, a
clever and dissipated man of fashion, with literary tastes, great
courage, an excellent wit, too often employed in obscenity, and
a remarkably ugly face. He was incorrupt and his political
professions were probably sincere. Behind him stood Temple,
ever ready to instigate others to stab the objects of his hate.
The court party was strengthened by grants of peerages, preferments,
and other good things, and "the king's friends," as
they began to call themselves, became a recognised body. Yet
Bute feared that parliament would be hostile, and made overtures
to Newcastle and Hardwicke, hoping to secure the duke's
influence; but they would not be cajoled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SECURING A MAJORITY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_27" id="TOPIC_27"></a>A majority for the peace had to be insured before the preliminaries
came before parliament. Grenville was dissatisfied
with some of the articles, and would in any case have been too
scrupulous for the work which had to be done. Bute was driven
to apply to Henry Fox, whom both the king and he cordially
disliked. Fox, who had previously sold his support to Bute at
the price of a peerage for his wife, was offered Grenville's place
as secretary of state and a peerage for himself, if he would take
the management of the commons. "We must," George said,
"call in bad men to govern bad men." Fox at once broke with
the whigs and accepted the leadership, but he refused the seals,
for he preferred to continue in the more lucrative office of paymaster
of the forces, which he had used during the last six
years as a means of amassing a great fortune. As paymaster
he had large sums of public money in his hands to meet calls at
fixed periods. Holders of the office were wont to employ such
sums for their own benefit. Pitt would not do so, and left the
office a poor man. Fox had no such scruples. During the war
the government often obtained ready money by issuing bills at
20 per cent discount. Fox bought these bills with the public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
money which lay in his hands. He also used the public money in
operating in government stock and gained immense profits from
the fluctuations of the funds, for as a minister he of course knew
more about the chances of peace than the public.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Grenville
was forced to resign the leadership to him, and the office of
secretary to Halifax, and take the admiralty in exchange.
Fox set about the business of securing a majority in the commons
by bribing members. In one day &pound;25,000 was paid out
of the treasury, and it is said even so small a sum as &pound;200 was
not refused.</p>

<p>Encouraged by Fox's success, George gave the whigs a
lesson on the fruits of opposition. The king, so the court party
said, would be king; the prerogative was to shine out. Devonshire,
the "prince of the whigs," was forced to resign the chamberlain's
staff; the king treated him uncivilly and with his
own hand struck his name from the list of privy councillors.
The whigs were enraged at this high-handed proceeding. The
Marquis of Rockingham resigned the bed-chamber, and George
received his resignation with indifference. Worse was yet to
come. Overtures were made to Pitt by the whigs who gathered
round Cumberland, but he would not connect himself with them.
They had defeated his policy, and though he desired Bute's
removal, he would not help to turn him out in order to put
Newcastle back in power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TERMS OF PEACE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_28" id="TOPIC_28"></a>The preliminaries of peace were signed on November 3, and
laid before parliament on the 29th. France agreed to restore
Minorca and to evacuate the territories of Hanover, Hesse,
Brunswick, and Prussia. Both parties were to withdraw their
troops from Germany. Dunkirk was to be dismantled. France
resigned Canada, Nova Scotia, and Cape Breton, together with
some territory hitherto claimed as part of Louisiana. Spain
ceded Florida and received back Havana and Manila. Portugal
was restored to its position as before the war. Great Britain restored
to France Belle Ile, Guadeloupe, Mariegalante, Martinique,
and St. Lucia, and retained Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica,
and Tobago. France was allowed a right of fishery in the gulf
of St. Lawrence and on the Newfoundland coast, and received
the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon as shelters, covenanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
not to fortify them. Spain gave up its claim to the Newfoundland
fishery, agreed that the dispute concerning prizes should be
settled by the courts, and acknowledged the right to cut logwood
on the Bay of Honduras. In Africa England restored Goree
to France and kept Senegal. In India France abandoned her
pretensions to conquests since 1749, and received back the
factories which she had at that date. As a compensation to
Spain for the loss of Florida, France ceded to her Louisiana;
a Spanish governor arrived there in 1766, but though Spain had
posts and settlements in the province, she can scarcely be said
to have ever had any effective hold upon it.</p>

<p>It was a glorious peace for Great Britain; it marks a signal
epoch in her imperial history. But it was not so advantageous
as she had a right to expect. Financially peace was desirable,
for the national debt of Great Britain and Ireland, which before
the war stood, as has already been stated, at &pound;72,505,572, had
risen to &pound;132,716,049, but her resources were by no means exhausted;
she could have continued the war without distress.
It is fairly certain that better terms might have been obtained
if the government had carried on the negotiations in
a different spirit. Martinique, specially valuable to a maritime
power, was surrendered without compensation; Manila was
simply thrown away through careless haste; Goree, on which
the French slave trade depended, might easily have been retained.
Grenville protested against the surrender of Guadeloupe,
and it was decided on when he was too ill to attend the
council. Florida was a poor exchange for Havana, the richest
of our conquests. Whether Pitt's policy of obtaining commercial
monopolies by force of arms was economically sound,
and whether the restoration of the French navy would have
been impeded so materially by exclusion from the fishery as he
believed, are questions on which we need not dwell here. The
treaty must be judged according to the beliefs of the time. As
it ceded valuable conquests without adequate compensation, and
encouraged France again to enter on a naval and commercial
policy by restoring to her Goree, colonies in the West Indies, and
her factories in India, and by granting her a share in the fisheries,
it was justly condemned as unsatisfactory. As regards the continental
war, the change in Frederick's position was sufficient
reason for our withdrawal from a quarrel which did not concern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
us. Yet he had some cause of complaint, for though the treaty
provided that the French should evacuate his territories, it did
not provide that the territories should be handed over to him.
He gained possession of them without difficulty, but for that he
owed no thanks to England. He believed that he had been
betrayed and deserted, and adopted an unfriendly attitude,
which was a hindrance to England's foreign policy in later years.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_29" id="TOPIC_29"></a>At home the peace was widely condemned. When parliament
met on November 25, Bute's coach was attacked and
he was in some danger. In the lords the address approving
the preliminaries was passed without a division. In the commons
the debate had begun when Pitt entered the house. He
was suffering from gout, and was carried by his servants within
the bar. Dressed in black velvet, and leaning on a crutch, he
advanced slowly to his seat, his limbs swathed in wrappings,
and his face pale with suffering. Yet he spoke for three hours
and forty minutes. After declaring that he was unconnected
with any party, he criticised the various articles of the treaty,
pointing out that they surrendered maritime and commercial
advantages which would have been doubly valuable because our
gain would have been the loss of France. The treatment of
Frederick he denounced as base and treacherous. The address
was carried by 319 to 65. The definitive treaty was signed at
Paris on February 10, 1763, and on the 15th Prussia and Austria
made peace at Hubertsburg. The majority was largely obtained
by corruption. Many members, however, no doubt welcomed
the peace, even though they were not fully satisfied with its
terms. The rout of the whigs was completed by their disunion;
some who would have voted against the address were discouraged
by Pitt's attitude of solitary independence.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The king had
succeeded in breaking up the whig party, and there was no
organised opposition. The court was triumphant. On hearing
the result of the division, the princess-dowager is said to have
exclaimed, "Now my son is King of England!" The victory
was followed up by a general proscription of the whigs; Newcastle,
Grafton, and Rockingham were dismissed from their
lord-lieutenancies. Nor was vengeance confined to the great.
All whigs who held places were deprived of them, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
poor clerks and excisemen lost the employments bestowed on
them by whig ministers. Fox urged on the execution of this
shameful business. Every effort was made to obtain congratulatory
addresses on the peace from municipal bodies, and money
was offered for them. London and several other places refused
to be won over by any means.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CIDER TAX.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_30" id="TOPIC_30"></a>The unpopularity of the administration was heightened by
its finance. Dashwood's scheme for the supplies included a
loan of &pound;3,000,000, which was negotiated on such extravagant
terms that the scrip soon rose to a premium of 11 per cent.
The loan was not open to public competition, it was distributed
among the chief supporters of the government; nine of them, it
is said, cleared each &pound;20,000, Fox &pound;10,000, and so on, while the
nation lost &pound;385,000 by the transaction. It was a new form of
corruption, specially dangerous because indirect.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> More general
indignation was excited by the proposal of a tax of four shillings
a hogshead on cider, to be paid by the maker and collected as
an excise. The tax was excessive in amount, onerous in its
conditions, and unfair in its incidence, for it fell equally on the
poorest and the most valuable cider, and pressed solely on
particular districts. It was, however, as an extension of the
excise laws that it was specially offensive to public feeling.
That was a matter on which Englishmen were extremely
jealous. Thirty years before a proposal for an extended excise
nearly wrecked the power of Sir Robert Walpole, who wisely
yielded to the storm. By Dashwood's scheme farmers were liable
to have the privacy of their homes invaded by the visits of excisemen.
Disturbances broke out in the cider counties, and troops
were moved into them. The excitement was general. London
petitioned against the tax, and its example was followed by many
other corporations and counties. Bute was violently assailed in
print, by Wilkes in prose and by his friend Churchill in verse.
A parliamentary opposition was organised; it was joined by
Pitt and Temple, and had its headquarters at Wildman's tavern
in Albemarle Street. Pitt spoke strongly against the tax in the
commons. It was defended by Grenville, who in the course of
his speech constantly demanded where another tax could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
laid. Mimicking his querulous tone, Pitt repeated aloud the
words of an old ditty, "Gentle shepherd, tell me where". The
nickname, Gentle shepherd, stuck by Grenville. The bill passed
the commons and was sent up to the lords. For the first time
since the revolution the lords divided on a money-bill, and voted
49 against, to 83 for its committal.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_31" id="TOPIC_31"></a>A few days later, on April 7, Bute announced that ill-health
compelled him to retire from office. The announcement caused
general surprise, but he had for some weeks determined to retire,
and had arranged with the king that Grenville should succeed
him. That he should have taken office was, Pitt wrote, more
astonishing than his departing from it.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He took office with the
intention of carrying out the king's policy of breaking up the
whig phalanx and bringing about a peace. Both objects were
accomplished. Though still strong in votes in the commons,
he had few allies of any weight, for Bedford was offended
with him. The newly formed opposition caused him uneasiness,
specially as it included Pitt and Temple; it was strong in
the lords, and he feared its influence in their chamber.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Though
his health was not materially affected, he was doubtless weary
of a task which he must have learned was too great for his
abilities. He knew that he was generally hated by the people,
and feared that if he remained longer in office, his unpopularity
would become injurious to the king. Before his resignation he
provided handsomely for his relations and friends at the expense
of the nation; reversions of &pound;52,000 a year were distributed
among them. Fox was rewarded by his creation as Baron Holland,
and managed to keep the pay office for two years longer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>THE GRENVILLE ADMINISTRATION.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_32" id="TOPIC_32"></a>The king appears to have received Bute's resignation without
regret; indeed it was remarked that the day before it was
announced he was in unusually good spirits, "like a person just
emancipated".<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Bute had done all that he could do for him as
prime minister; he had cleared the ground for the establishment
of the king's system of government; the whig oligarchy
was disorganised and overthrown, and the war was at an end.
George could not have wished to keep a minister in office who
was hated by his people; that would have been contrary to
the idea of a patriot king, and would in time have made him
unpopular. Nor was he perhaps altogether satisfied with Bute's
conduct in office; for in later life he observed that he was
"deficient in political firmness".<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Bute was to continue to be
useful to him in another capacity in which political firmness was
not so important; he was to be the king's private adviser, and
help him to select and manage his responsible ministers.
Through his instrumentality, George had already secured a set
of ministers who would, they both believed, be content to carry
out the king's will. Grenville, though he had opposed Bute in
the cabinet with reference to the negotiations with France, professed
that as prime minister he would try to win his complete
approval, and with only one exception allowed Bute to form his
administration for him. Bute and his master thought they had
secured a useful tool, a subservient and hard-working drudge.
They were mistaken in their man; Grenville was independent
and self-confident. He took the two offices of first lord of the
treasury and chancellor of the exchequer. Dashwood retired
with Bute and the barony of Despencer was called out of abey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ance
in his favour. Halifax and Egremont remained secretaries
of state and Henley lord chancellor. Bedford distrusted Bute
and refused to take office. The new administration promised
to exercise economy, and Grenville took care that the
pledge should be redeemed. Its frugality did not make it
popular; it did not command the confidence of the nation, and
was generally considered a feeble continuation of its predecessor.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_33" id="TOPIC_33"></a>The king prorogued parliament on April 19, 1763; his speech
described the peace as honourable to his crown, and claimed, or
at least implied, that it had induced the enemies of the Prussian
king "to agree to a peace which he had approved". On the
23rd appeared No. 45 of the <i>North Briton</i> with a violent
denunciation of the speech. It declared that the king had given
"the sanction of his sacred name to the most odious measures
and to the most unjustifiable public declarations from a throne
ever renowned for truth, honour, and unsullied virtue". That
the ministers were responsible for the king's speech was well
understood, and was clearly recognised in the article. George
took the article as conveying an accusation of falsehood against
himself personally, and there was some excuse for this interpretation
of it. Other numbers of the paper had been violent, and
had been passed by without notice. His present ministers were
not deficient in political firmness; he ordered them to prosecute
the writer. Halifax thereupon issued a general warrant, that is
a warrant directed against persons not named, ordering the
king's messengers to search for the authors, printers, and publishers
of the <i>North Briton</i>, arrest them and seize their papers.
Warrants of this kind to be executed on persons not named,
without evidence of their identity or guilt, had hitherto been
held lawful, but they were subversive of the liberty of the subject
and contrary to the spirit of the constitution. During three
days forty-nine persons were arrested under this warrant.
Among them were the avowed publisher of the <i>North Briton</i>,
the printer, and his workmen. They declared that Wilkes was
the author.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROCEEDINGS IN WILKES'S CASE.</i></div>

<p>Wilkes was arrested under the general warrant on the 30th,
and carried before the secretaries of state; his house was
searched and his papers seized. He was committed to the
Tower. He hoped, he said, that he might have the room in
which Egremont's father had been confined as a rebel, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
referring to the popular belief as to the consequences of the
dirty habits of Bute's fellow-countrymen, in any case, one which
had not been tenanted by a Scot. Temple at once applied on
his behalf for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, which was granted by
Pratt, chief justice of the common pleas, but as Wilkes was no
longer in the custody of the messengers, they could not produce
him. He was kept in close confinement; Temple and the
Duke of Grafton who went to see him were not admitted, and
even his solicitor was denied access to him. A new writ was
issued, and on May 3 he was brought before the court of
common pleas. He pleaded his privilege as a member of
parliament. Pratt delivered judgment on the 6th and decided
that he was entitled to the privilege of parliament, which
extended to all offences save treason, felony, and breach of the
peace. The other judges concurred, and he was set at liberty.
The crowd which had collected in Westminster Hall received
the result of the trial with loud applause, and escorted Wilkes
to his house in Great George Street. Meanwhile Egremont had
in the king's name ordered Temple, the lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire,
to deprive Wilkes of his commission as colonel of
the Bucks militia. In forwarding this order to Wilkes, Temple
added some complimentary expressions, and on the 7th the earl
was dismissed both from his lieutenancy and the privy council.</p>

<p>Several persons who were arrested on the general warrant
brought actions against the messengers. In the first of
these suits Pratt, setting aside evil precedents, declared general
warrants to be illegal. A master-printer obtained &pound;400 damages,
one journeyman &pound;300, and others &pound;200. Wilkes sued
Wood, the under-secretary of state, for ransacking his house,
and the jury awarded him &pound;1,000 damages. He also began
actions for false imprisonment against the two secretaries of
state. His suit against Egremont was cut short by the earl's
death on August 20. Halifax took advantage of various legal
devices to delay the hearing of the suit against himself, and it
was not decided until six years later. Temple, who had paid
Wilkes's law expenses, wished him to avoid giving further cause
of offence. Wilkes, however, set up a press in his own house,
reprinted the <i>North Briton</i> in volumes, and printed other matter
also. The arbitrary proceedings of the government in this case
excited much adverse feeling, especially in London, and gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a fresh impetus to the discontent in the cider districts. They
were attributed to Bute's influence. In some western villages a
man in Scottish dress led about an ass decorated with a blue
ribbon and wearing a paper crown; and at Exeter an effigy of
Bute remained hanging on a gibbet for a fortnight, no one
daring to remove it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MINISTERIAL CHANGES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_34" id="TOPIC_34"></a>George, though at first well pleased with the new administration,
soon saw that it lacked strength. He made an attempt
to enlist Hardwicke and Newcastle, but they would not take
office without their party. Bute advised an offer to Bedford,
who declared that he would not join the government unless
Bute would undertake to retire, not only from the court, but
from London. Negotiations were also carried on with Pitt,
whom Bute was most anxious to secure for the king. Pitt made
it clearly understood that he would not take office with Bedford,
the man most responsible for the peace, nor would he come in
alone. In spite of Pitt's objection to him, Bedford, who did
not care for office, advised the king to take him. George
was dissatisfied with his ministers; he was annoyed by their
unpopularity and by the growth of a spirit of turbulence among
the lower classes, and personally was wearied by the constant
interviews and the long harangues which Grenville inflicted
upon him. Bute, too, was not finding Grenville so anxious to
win his approval as he expected, and on Egremont's death had an
interview with Pitt. The result was satisfactory; and George,
much to Grenville's disgust, told him that he meant to ask Pitt to
enter the administration, and would "do it as cheap as he could,"
with as few changes as possible. Pitt had an interview with the
king on August 27. Both evidently thought that there was
nothing to prevent him from taking office, and he communicated
with Devonshire, Newcastle, and Rockingham. The next day
George seems to have changed his mind; he told Grenville that
Pitt's terms were too hard. Bute is said to have instigated this
change, and it is probable that both he and the king were disappointed
at finding that Pitt meant to bring in with him several
of the whig leaders. Pitt had a second interview with the king
on the 29th, and George is said to have closed it with the
words: "Well, Mr. Pitt, I see this will not do. My honour is
concerned and I must support it." Pitt's proposals were probably
exaggerated by the ministerial party. It is certain that he pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>posed
several changes, and the admission of some of the leading
whigs, and that either he or the king suggested Temple
for the treasury. George had made up his mind before the
interview that it would probably be useless. Both he and
Bute would gladly have secured Pitt's support, but they wanted
him to take office alone, or at least not with a party. George
had no mind for another whig administration with Pitt as its
master-spirit.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_35" id="TOPIC_35"></a>He again turned to Bedford and told him that Pitt had
stipulated that he was to have no office, even about the court, at
that time, though in future years he might be permitted to hold
a court appointment, and that no favour should be shown to any
one concerned in the peace. George may well have believed that
this was the meaning of Pitt's words. Even so, he should
not have divulged anything which took place in his closet,
specially if it was likely to make mischief; he was, however,
in serious difficulties. His device succeeded. Though Bedford
was already aware that Pitt would not act with him, he was
piqued at this fresh declaration of hostility; he agreed to take
office, and, on September 9, was appointed president of the
council in succession to Lord Granville who died in the previous
January. He was considered head of the administration. The
Earl of Sandwich became secretary of state and took the northern department,
and Lord Hillsborough succeeded Lord Shelburne as president
of the board of trade. Sandwich had official experience, and
was neither idle nor incapable, though unprincipled and extremely
profligate; Hillsborough was deficient in tact and judgment.
Shelburne had been one of Bute's followers, and arranged
his bargains with Fox, who accused him of having deceived him.
He was employed in the late negotiations with Pitt, resigned
office on their failure, and attached himself to Pitt. The king
was completely in the hands of Bedford and Grenville, his only
defence against an administration composed of whig magnates.
They used their power to force him to send Bute out of London.
This insolent conduct was specially reprehensible in the case of
Grenville, who owed his advancement to Bute's recommendation.
Grenville continued to weary the king with interviews; he
worried him with his disputes with his colleagues, and irritated
him beyond endurance by suggestions, which were not ill-founded,
that he was still under Bute's influence. "Good God,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Mr. Grenville," the poor king exclaimed, "am I to be suspected
after all I have done?"</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_36" id="TOPIC_36"></a>Parliament met on November 15, and the government at
once made an attack on Wilkes. In the lords, Sandwich complained
of two profane and obscene pieces printed in his private
press, <i>An Essay on Woman</i> and a paraphrase of the <i>Veni
Creator</i>. There was no evidence of publication; a few copies
only were printed, evidently for private circulation, and one of
them was obtained by tampering with a workman. Even if
publication had been proved, there would still have been no
reason for the lords' interference; for obscene and profane
publications were punishable by law. But the ministers were
anxious to obtain support for their measures of revenge. The
name of Bishop Warburton of Gloucester was attached in
mockery to notes in the <i>Essay on Woman</i>, and with his concurrence
the case was brought before the house as a breach of
privilege. The lords lent themselves to this transparent device;
they petitioned the king to command the prosecution of Wilkes
and, later, when he was out of their reach, ordered that he
should be confined for his offence against themselves. Their
proceedings excited public ridicule. That Sandwich should
complain of obscenity and profanity, and should censure Wilkes,
a fellow-monk of Dashwood's debauched fraternity, for indulging
in them was, indeed, a case of Satan rebuking sin. At a performance
of the "Beggar's Opera" at Covent Garden theatre the
audience caught up with delight Macheath's words, "That
Jemmy Twitcher should peach me I own surprised me," and
Sandwich became generally known as Jemmy Twitcher.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WILKES EXPELLED FROM PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_37" id="TOPIC_37"></a>On the same day as the proceedings in the lords, Grenville
brought a message from the king to the commons informing
them of what had been done in Wilkes's case. They voted, 273
to 111, that the <i>North Briton</i>, No. 45, was a false and seditious
libel, and ordered that it should be burnt by the common
hangman. In the course of the debate, Martin, who had lately
been secretary to the treasury, called Wilkes a cowardly and
malignant scoundrel. The next day, the 16th, they fought a
duel with pistols in the ring in Hyde Park; they had no seconds
and each fired twice. Martin's second shot wounded Wilkes
dangerously. In his absence the commons discussed his plea of
privilege. Pitt strongly urged the house to maintain its privileges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Parliament, he said, had no right to surrender them; if it did so
it would endanger its own freedom and infringe upon the rights
of the people. As for Wilkes personally, Pitt was anxious to
show that he did not approve of Temple's support of him, and
called him "the blasphemer of his God and the libeller of his
king". The house voted by 258 to 133 that privilege of parliament
does not extend to seditious libels, and ought not to
obstruct the ordinary course of the law in such cases. In itself
this was an excellent decision. Parliamentary privileges had
increased to a mischievous extent. By the abandonment of
many of them, such as certain invidious exemptions from the
course of law which it claimed for its members, the exclusion of
strangers from its debates, and the prohibition of reporting,
parliament has gained in dignity and purity, and has confirmed
the liberties of the people. Nevertheless, though the abandonment
of privilege was in itself a step in a right direction, it was
reprehensible in Wilkes's case, because it was an <i>ex post facto</i>
measure, designed to meet a special case, and vindictive in its
intention.</p>

<p>The lords agreed in the decision of the commons, though a
protest against the surrender of privilege was signed by seventeen
peers. On December 3, the day fixed for the burning of
No. 45 in front of the Royal Exchange, a large mob broke the
windows of the sheriff's coach and pelted the constables. Encouraged
by gentlemen at the windows of neighbouring houses,
they tore a large part of the paper from the executioner with
shouts of "Wilkes and liberty," carried it in triumph outside
Temple Bar, the boundary of the city, and there made a bonfire
into which they threw a jack-boot and a petticoat, the popular
emblems of Bute and the Princess of Wales. Yet Wilkes was
in an unpleasant position. A Scot went to his house intending
to murder him; was arrested and found insane. A summons
was sent to him to appear at the bar of the house of commons;
his surgeons stated that he was too ill to attend, and a later day
was fixed. Before it came he went off secretly to Paris, and
while there excused himself from obedience to the order of the
house by sending a medical certificate. The commons refused
to give any weight to it, declared him in contempt, and guilty
of a seditious libel, and on January 19, 1764, expelled him the
house. An information was laid against him in the court of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
king's bench for reprinting and publishing No. 45; he was convicted
and, as he did not appear to receive sentence, was outlawed.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_38" id="TOPIC_38"></a>While little sympathy seems to have been felt for Wilkes
personally, except among the lower classes, the attack upon him
was widely resented because it was regarded as an encroachment
on national liberty. Parliament was not in accord with public
feeling. A strong effort was made to induce the commons to
declare that general warrants were illegal. Pitt acknowledged
that he had issued them during the war, when it was necessary to
find out and remove suspected persons; but no such necessity
existed at present, and he urged the house to do justice to the
nation, the constitution, and the law, by condemning them. The
ministers managed to shelve the question, but carried the adjournment
only by 234 to 218. Though on other matters they
commanded a large majority, several members from whom they
expected support voted against them in the debates arising out
of Wilkes's arrest. Among these were General Conway and
Colonel Barr&eacute;. Conway, the brother of the Earl of Hertford,
had gained much credit in the war in Germany; he was a dashing
officer and a respectable general, a man of refined tastes and high
principles. As a politician he was thoroughly honest, of small
ability and utterly wanting in decision of character. He was the
dearest friend of Horace Walpole; and Walpole, who regarded
politics in a personal light, exercised an unfortunate influence
upon him. Barr&eacute;, who had served with distinction in Canada, was
a coarse man, eloquent, and feared by his opponents on account
of his remarkable power of invective. He sat for one of Shelburne's
boroughs, and believing himself slighted by Pitt, attacked
him vehemently in the house on his resignation of office. As a
supporter of Bute he was appointed adjutant-general and governor
of Stirling, posts worth &pound;4,000 a year. George, who regarded a
vote against the ministers in this matter as a personal affront to
himself, was determined that all who held either military or civil
appointments should clearly understand that they could not continue
to serve him if they opposed his policy in parliament.
With Bedford's approval, Conway, Barr&eacute;, and with them General
A'Court, who had also voted in the minority, were deprived of
their commands, and Shelburne, Barr&eacute;'s patron, was dismissed
from his office as aide-de-camp to the king. Barr&eacute; followed
Shelburne's example in attaching himself to Pitt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GRENVILLE'S ECONOMY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_39" id="TOPIC_39"></a>These dismissals violated the most valuable of the privileges
of parliament, freedom of speech and immunity from royal
coercion. It was a well-established constitutional rule that the
king should not take notice of anything which passed in parliament
and that no member should suffer for his speeches or votes.
This rule had been broken in the last reign when, in 1733, two
officers lost their commands and, in 1735, Pitt his cornetcy for
acting with the opposition. On the present occasion the responsibility
for its violation rests on Grenville at least as much as on the
king himself. Parliament took little notice of this infringement
upon its privileges, though on the first day of the session, 1765,
Granby pleased the army by some sharp remarks on the dismission
of officers on account of their votes in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Encouraged
by their success against Wilkes, the ministers waged war
on political libels. A large number of <i>ex officio</i> informations, or
accusations presented by the attorney-general on which the person
accused was brought to trial without the previous finding of
a grand jury, were laid against printers and others during the
course of the year. As this looked like persecution, it excited
popular anger. One bookseller who was sentenced to stand in
the pillory in New-palace-yard, Westminster, drove thither in
a hackney coach numbered 45, and was cheered by a crowd
estimated at 10,000 persons. Two hundred guineas was collected
for him, and the mob hung a jack-boot and a "Scotch
bonnet" on a gibbet and then burnt them.</p>

<p>Grenville insisted on economy in the national expenditure;
it was needful, for during the late war the public debt had
risen from &pound;72,500,000 to &pound;132,700,000, and the country was
heavily taxed. His budget stood in honourable contrast to the
finance of the late administration; it did not propose lotteries
or a private loan, and it included an advantageous bargain
with the Bank of England for the renewal of its charter. Yet
in some matters his economy was short-sighted and peddling.
He starved the naval estimates. During the war many ships
were built hastily of timber insufficiently seasoned, and had fallen
into so bad a condition that half their original cost was needed
for the repair of their hulls; there were too few workmen in
the dockyards, and the stores were empty of sails, rigging, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
cordage. Lord Egmont, the first lord of the admiralty, represented
the necessity for a large expenditure on the navy,
but Grenville would not hear of it. So, too, in less important
matters, he grudged spending money on the police of London,
and highway robbery and other crimes of violence were insufficiently
checked, and he even refused so small a sum as
&pound;20,000 which the king wanted for the purchase of some land
at the back of Buckingham House, the site of part of the present
Grosvenor Place, in order that the garden which he was then
making might not be overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_40" id="TOPIC_40"></a>The expenditure on the American colonies and the irregularities
by which they evaded their legal obligations, were offensive
to his frugal and orderly temperament; he proposed to
enforce their obligations, and to draw from the colonies some
part of their cost to the mother-country. The colonies occupied
a long and comparatively narrow tract of country stretching
for seventeen hundred miles along the Atlantic. They differed
in character. In the northern colonies the puritan element was
strong, and the chief sources of wealth were commerce and
farming. The southern colonies had cavalier traditions, and
their wealth was chiefly derived from plantations which were
cultivated by slave labour. Though puritanism as a religious
force was well-nigh extinct in the New England provinces,
it affected the temper of the people; they set a high value
on speech-making and fine words, and were litigious and
obstinate; lawyers were plentiful among them, and had much
influence. As a whole the colonies were impatient of control
and jealous of interference. Their constitutions differed in
various points; in some the governor was appointed by the
crown, in others by the proprietary. All alike enjoyed a large
measure of personal and political freedom: they had the form
and substance of the British constitution; they had representative
assemblies in which they taxed themselves for their
domestic purposes, chose most of their own magistrates, and
paid them all; and it was seldom that their legislation was
interfered with except with respect to commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESTRICTIONS ON COLONIAL TRADE.</i></div>

<p>The freedom which they enjoyed did not extend to commerce
and manufactures. In those matters the policy of Great
Britain was founded on the "mercantile theory," then universally
accepted, and was directed towards securing a monopoly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of trade. Other countries pursued a like policy towards their
colonies, though they treated them with far less liberality. The
restrictions placed by Great Britain on colonial trade were based
on the Navigation acts of 1660 and later years, which were
originally aimed at the maritime power of the Dutch. Briefly,
they confined trade with the colonies to English or colonial
ships; the Americans were debarred from exporting a number
of the most important products of their country, their tobacco,
grain, sugar, hides, and timber for masts, except to Great
Britain; no foreign ship might enter their harbours, nor, with
certain exceptions, could they import foreign merchandise,
except in ships sailing directly from England. Various acts
debarred them from manufactures which would have entered
into competition with English goods; they depended on the
mother-country for the commonest and most necessary things,
for their cloth, hardware, and a host of manufactured articles.
Port duties were imposed by England, and were collected by
officers of the customs, whose business it was to prevent contraband
trading. These duties were not imposed for the sake
of revenue, but for the regulation of trade; and the whole system
of restrictions was founded on the idea that colonies should be
made to serve the interest of the mother-country by giving its
merchants and manufacturers the monopoly of the colonial
market.</p>

<p>The colonies received some compensations for the restrictions
placed upon their industry and commerce. With certain exceptions
their trade was free. While some of their products
were confined to the British market, they had the monopoly of
that market; no Englishman, for example, might buy tobacco
which did not come from America or Bermuda. Their export
trade to England was encouraged by bounties, and, though their
foreign imports generally had to come to them through England,
a system of drawbacks, by which the duties were remitted on
exportation to America, enabled them to buy continental goods
more cheaply than they could be bought in England. Nothing
indeed can be further from the truth than the idea that England's
treatment of her colonies was harsh or illiberal. Unfortunately
the mercantile theory set up an opposition between the interests
of a mother-country and her colonies. A far more important
mitigation of the restrictions imposed on the colonies than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
that came from English liberality, was derived from the constant
violation of them. Few English statesmen knew or cared to
know anything about colonial affairs. Left to themselves the
American colonies grew rich. Their merchants, especially in
New England, carried on a brisk and extremely profitable
contraband trade. In exchange for lumber, fish, and cattle the
New England merchants obtained sugar and molasses, and
bullion from the French and Spanish colonies; and vast quantities
of rum were distilled in Boston and exported to Africa to
be used in the slave trade.</p>

<p>England was not altogether a loser by these transactions.
The richer a Boston merchant became, the more British goods
did he import, and as he had to pay for them in bullion, his
contraband trade enabled him to meet his obligations. These
advantages were indirect, the loss to the English West India
merchants was obvious and heavy. In order to protect them an
attempt was made in 1733 to stop this contraband trade by the
imposition of heavy duties; but the profits of the trade were so
large that the revenue officers found it to their interest to be
careless or actually conniving, and scarcely any duties were paid.
On an average the American customs cost England from &pound;7,000
to &pound;8,000 a year and did not bring in quite &pound;2,000. During
the war the contraband trade afforded the French useful supplies,
and in 1760 Pitt ordered the colonial governors to punish those
who traded with the enemy. More power was placed in the
hands of the revenue officers by the issue of writs of assistance
enabling them to search for dutiable articles in any place without
alleging specific information. These writs were lawful and were
specially justifiable in time of war. Their lawfulness was unsuccessfully
disputed before the superior court of Massachusetts
by a lawyer named Otis, an eloquent speaker, singularly devoid
of moderation. His speech, in which rhetoric is more conspicuous
than a knowledge of law, attacked the commercial
legislation of parliament generally; it was much admired, and
has been regarded by some Americans as the first step towards
revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND AND HER COLONIES.</i></div>

<p>A system which cramped the trade and industry of a self-reliant
people, growing in wealth and intent on gain, for the
benefit of a country separated from them by 3,000 miles of
ocean, then only crossed by sailing ships, must sooner or later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
have led to revolt. The Americans were impatient of control
and apt to quarrel with their governors, who often found their
office an unenviable one. "Such wrong-headed people," said
one of them, "I thank God I had never to do with before."
They were not a people patiently to submit to restrictions.
Two causes had contributed to bind them to Great Britain.
One of these was their fear of the French in Canada. So
long as the French and their Indian allies threatened their
homes, even the most turbulent of them knew that they gained
by being subjects of the English king. The war with France
called forth a feeling of loyalty. The triumph of England
freed them from the fear of French aggression and their protestations
of gratitude were exuberant. Yet there were many
who saw that the conquest of Canada loosened the tie which
bound the American colonies to the mother-country and would
probably lead to an assertion of independence. Separation
would, however, have been impossible without union. The
jealousies between the colonies were so strong that revolt seemed
improbable. Were they left to themselves, Otis declared in
1765, "America would be a mere shambles of blood and confusion".
A common cause alone could bring about union, and
such a cause was soon to be found. The termination of the war
enabled the ministers to direct their attention to the contraband
trade which had assisted the common enemy, defrauded the
government, and annoyed the commercial class. During Bute's
administration, in 1763, revenue cutters were sent to cruise off
the American coast, the officers of the king's ships were sworn
to act as revenue officers, and revenue cases were heard in the
admiralty courts. Smuggling was more effectually checked,
and the irritation caused by the loss of trade was aggravated by
the roughness with which the seamen enforced the law.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_41" id="TOPIC_41"></a>Grenville adopted a new policy apparently contemplated by
Bute's ministry. Hitherto parliament had imposed customs
duties on the colonies solely for the purpose of regulating trade;
he designed to raise revenue from them. The idea was suggested
to Walpole as a means of obtaining money on the failure of his
excise scheme, and that wary statesman promptly rejected it.
The money, however, which Grenville hoped to raise from the
colonies was not to swell the revenues of England; it was to be
applied to their own defence. His design was reasonable. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
war had enormously increased the public debt. It is true that it
was not undertaken only for the defence of the colonies; it is
not less true that it was not a merely insular war. The war concerned
the empire at large, and Great Britain's lavish sacrifices of
blood and treasure delivered her children across the ocean from
the fear of French conquest. Her expenditure on their defence
could not end with the war; a small standing army had to be
maintained for their protection. It seemed not unlikely that
France would attempt to regain her lost dominions; it would
have been fatal to leave the American colonies undefended.
And another foe was always at hand, for the Indians regretted
the overthrow of the French and were exasperated by the
ill-treatment they received from the British colonists. In 1763
Pontiac, head-chief of the Ottawas, formed a confederation
against the English. Along the borders of Pennsylvania, Virginia,
and Maryland the Indians massacred outlying settlers,
surprised many forts and slew their garrisons. Three provinces
might have been overrun before the inhabitants had organised
any defence, had not Sir Jeffrey (later Lord) Amherst, the
commander-in-chief, had a small British force at his disposal,
consisting mainly of companies of the 7th, 42nd, and 77th
regiments of the line, and of the Royal American regiment
(later the 60th Rifles), formed in 1755 for service in America.
A little army composed largely of men of the 42nd Highlanders,
and commanded by Colonel Bouquet, defeated the Indians at
Bushy Run on August 5. Fort Pitt was relieved and, the victory
having encouraged the provincials to make a stand, the war
virtually ended in November, 1764.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STAMP ACT PROPOSED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_42" id="TOPIC_42"></a>The provincials disliked the idea of a standing army, and
would have preferred that their defence should have been left to
themselves. That was impossible. They were largely farmers
and traders, peaceful folk unwilling to leave their profitable
pursuits. There was no central authority to dictate the proportion
of troops which each of the colonies should contribute to a
common force, and their selfishness and jealousies made them
grudge help one to another. The Americans behaved shabbily
to the troops sent to defend them, but Pontiac's war proved that
in times of pressing danger their safety might depend upon the
presence of a British force. Was it right or just that the colonies
should be defended by England and should contribute nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
towards the cost of their defence? Grenville thought that it
was not. On March 10, 1764, he laid before parliament a list
of port dues; some of them were higher than before, and to
counterbalance the increase he proposed to give several new
advantages to colonial trade. Payment was no longer to be
evaded so easily as in past times, and smuggling would be
attended with greater risk. The money was to be paid into the
English treasury and was to be used only for colonial defence.
More would be wanted for that purpose, and he proposed to
raise it by an act requiring that all legal documents should bear
stamps. This measure he deferred for a year in order to ascertain
the feeling of the colonies and to give them an opportunity
of raising the money in some other way if they preferred it.
The force to be kept in America was twenty regiments, or about
10,000 men, which, with the maintenance of fortifications, would
cost &pound;350,000 a year. Of this sum the proposed stamp act
would, it was calculated, bring in about &pound;100,000. The bill
passed without remark.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_43" id="TOPIC_43"></a>In an interview with the agents of the colonies Grenville
pointed out that the tax was reasonable, and was an easy and
equitable way of raising the required money, but promised that
if the colonies disliked it, and would raise the money themselves
in some other way, he would be content. Before the year was
out they met him again and, acting on instructions from their
colonies, tried to dissuade him from his purpose. Chief among
them was Benjamin Franklin, then agent for Pennsylvania, a
New Englander by birth, not a puritan either in religion or
morals, a wise politician, shrewd, public-spirited, inventive, and
full of schemes of practical usefulness. He proposed that the
money should be voted by the provincial assemblies, but could
not say that the colonies would agree as to the amount which
each should contribute. On that of course the whole matter
depended. When Grenville brought in his stamp bill the debate,
Burke says, was extremely languid. Parliament had no
idea that the act would lead to serious consequences. Nor were
the American agents much better informed, for Franklin, who
considered that a small standing army might be useful, believed
that the colonies had no choice but to submit to the tax. Pitt
was absent from parliament, suffering from gout. Conway
and Barr&eacute; opposed the bill, and Barr&eacute;, in a speech of fervid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
eloquence, described the Americans as "sons of liberty," driven
from their country by tyranny and treated by her with neglect.
In the commons the bill was carried with only forty dissentients,
and in the lords apparently without a division. It received the
royal assent on March 22, 1765, and was to come into operation
on November 1. In April the mutiny act was extended to
America, binding the colonies to provide the king's troops with
quarters and certain necessaries, such as fuel and candles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AMERICAN RESISTANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_44" id="TOPIC_44"></a>The stamp act raised a storm of indignation in the American
colonies. Some of them, and especially the New England
colonies, already had a substantial grievance in the heavy blow
dealt to their prosperity by the repression of their contraband
trade. Their discontent was increased by a suspicion that
England was about to establish episcopacy among them at their
expense, for Archbishop Secker and other English churchmen
were anxious to introduce bishops into America. A more
sentimental, though an efficient cause of irritation also existed in
the affectation of superiority adopted by Englishmen towards
their colonial fellow-subjects. The stamp tax brought their discontent
to a head, and gave the party hostile to government
an opportunity for stirring up opposition. During the year
unwisely allowed by Grenville for considering the proposed
tax, they busily agitated against it. While at that time the
Americans allowed that parliament had a right to impose duties
for the regulation of trade, they denied its right to levy an
internal tax for the purpose of revenue, because they were not
represented in parliament.</p>

<p>Opposition to the ministerial policy naturally began in
Boston, where the repression of contraband trade weighed most
heavily and where&mdash;though that was a smaller matter&mdash;the
dislike to episcopacy was specially strong. The town-meeting
promptly passed resolutions denying the right of parliament to
tax the colonies without their consent. The meeting was led
by Samuel Adams, a man of frugal life and austere character,
who, after failing as a brewer and as a tax collector, adopted
the career most congenial to his tastes and talents of political
agitator. The resolutions were adopted by the provincial assembly,
and on its invitation five other colonies joined with
Massachusetts in sending memorials and petitions to England
against the proposed tax. The assembly of Virginia was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
session when the news came that the tax was enacted, and
Patrick Henry, a lawyer, brought forward some defiant resolutions,
of which four were carried, though only by a small
majority. His speech, which contained an insolent reference
to the king, was much admired. A general congress of the
colonies was proposed by Massachusetts and met at New York
on November 7. Representatives of nine colonies attended and
others sent expressions of good-will. The members drew up a
statement of their claims and grievances in moderate terms, and
further expressed them in an address to the king, a memorial to
the lords, and a petition to the commons.</p>

<p>These orderly proceedings were accompanied by outbursts of
lawless violence. Societies for resistance were organised. The
"sons of liberty," as they called themselves in reference to
Barr&eacute;'s speech, were active in Boston, and in August, 1765,
a mob plundered the house of a man who was nominated as a
distributor of stamps, destroyed a building on his land which
they believed was to be used as a stamp-office, hanged him in
effigy, and forced him to renounce his appointment. A sermon
preached by Jonathan Mayhew, a popular unitarian minister, on
the words "I would that they were even cut off which trouble
you," was followed by a more serious riot. Public buildings
were attacked, the records of the admiralty court were burnt,
and the rioters forced their way into the custom-house and got at
the liquor in the cellars. Maddened by drink they wrecked the
stately mansion of Hutchinson, the lieutenant-governor, and
destroyed his fine collection of books and manuscripts. Persons
of good position more or less openly encouraged these excesses
and no one was punished for them. Outbreaks of mob violence,
though of a less riotous kind, took place in Rhode Island, Connecticut,
and elsewhere. On November 1, the day on which the
stamp act came into operation, copies of it were offered for sale
headed, "The folly of England and the ruin of America," bells
were tolled, and mock funerals passed through the streets.</p>

<p>Everywhere the new stamps were seized and destroyed. At
New York the lieutenant-governor, encouraged by the presence
of the king's troops, tried to secure the stamps sent to the town.
A riot ensued. General Gage, the commander-in-chief, declined
to interfere at the risk of beginning a civil war, and the stamps
were surrendered and locked up in the town hall. Besides these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
not a parcel of stamps was left in the colonies. For a time this
put an end to legal business, and the courts were closed. Then
lawyers agreed to take no notice of the lack of stamps on documents,
and at last the governors declared that the operation of
the act was to be reckoned as suspended. Retaliatory measures
were concerted. Merchants combined to stop all importation
from England, cancelled their orders and delayed sending remittances.
Associations were formed for abandoning the use
of English goods, and the richest citizens either wore old clothes
or rough material of colonial production. Manufactories of
linen, cloth, and hardware were started, and in order to insure a
supply of wool, butchers were forbidden by their customers to
kill lambs.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_45" id="TOPIC_45"></a>The distinction made by the party of resistance between
external and internal taxation was in accordance with previous
practice. Though parliament had frequently imposed port-duties
on the colonies, it had abstained from imposing taxes
within them. The stamp act was a new departure. English
history afforded ground for the distinction, which was alleged
in Bate's case, in the reign of James I., in support of the claim
of the crown. Yet it is clearly artificial, for a division of taxes,
such as into external and internal, only concerns their incidence;
it is a matter which belongs to economics and does not affect
political right. The colonists' claim of exemption from parliamentary
taxation on the ground of non-representation appeals to
the sympathy of Englishmen. Both in England and America
there were some who desired that the colonies should be represented
in parliament, but their distance from England and the
ignorance of both peoples as regards the circumstances and
needs of each other would have been fatal objections to any
such scheme. The claim of the colonists seems to imply a
misapprehension of the character of parliament; for parliament
is not a mere meeting of delegates, it is an imperial assembly,
and its sovereignty is neither derived from the perfection of its
constitution nor lessened by its imperfection. Taxation is an
attribute of sovereignty, and parliament had a right to tax the
colonies because the sovereign power resided in it. Where else
could it reside? To deny the right to tax and to admit the
right to legislate was inconsistent. How could parliament, in
virtue of its sovereign authority, have a right to pass a bill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
ensuring personal freedom in the colonies, and yet have no right
to pass another bill imposing a tax on them? The logical outcome
of the American contention was that all parliamentary
legislation concerning the colonies was null, except so far as
they chose to admit it. Under all their arguments lay the
germ of independence, though as yet the leaders of the agitation
loudly professed loyalty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNSTATESMANLIKE POLICY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_46" id="TOPIC_46"></a>That the tax was reasonable in intention, equitable in incidence,
and in itself tolerable, few probably will now deny. Nor
will any one surely deny that the act was foolish and unstatesmanlike.
Strict definitions of legal right are not safe guides in
practical politics: sentiment and circumstances should be held
to be of far greater account. The Americans maintained that
there was an important difference between external and internal
taxation, and, in common with all other Englishmen, they highly
valued the right expressed in the maxim, "No taxation without
representation". It was a fatal mistake to disregard their belief
and, for the sake of avoiding a not very serious expenditure, to
seem to deny what they claimed as their heritage as Englishmen.
Heavy as its expenses were, Great Britain could have
afforded to take upon itself the sum required for the defence
of the colonies. Grenville could not see the matter in this light.
Well-meaning and wishing to act fairly both towards England
and the colonies, he brought trouble on both alike by his insistence
on legal right. His administration was fruitful in evil.
He permitted parliament to enter on a disastrous struggle with
Wilkes in order to gratify the king; he raised up discord
between England and her most important colonies; he allowed
the strength of England to decay by grudging to spend the
money needed for the maintenance of the navy, and its dignity
to be impaired by neglecting to insist on the payment of the
Manila ransom, though for that he was not individually responsible.
One judicious act of his administration may be recorded
here. The Isle of Man, though under the allegiance of the king,
was not fully under the royal authority; the king had no courts
and no officers there, and it was, as Burke said, "the very citadel
of smuggling". In 1765 the crown bought the rights of the
Duke and Duchess of Atholl over the island for &pound;70,000, and
it became thenceforward an integral part of the realm of England.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>THE KING, THE WHIGS, AND CHATHAM.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_47" id="TOPIC_47"></a>Both for public and personal reasons George was anxious to
get rid of his ministers. Unlike them, he appears as early as
the spring of 1765 to have considered the discontent of his
American subjects a serious matter, and he blamed them for it.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
In other respects, too, he was dissatisfied with their public conduct,
and he complained bitterly of their behaviour towards
himself. In spite of some outward agreement in action, he and
Grenville, who without the name retained nearly all the authority
of prime minister, pursued fundamentally different systems.
Grenville, though not less ready than the king to meet opposition
with violent measures, was imbued with whig theories. While
George sought to rule by securing the support of parliament,
Grenville tried to use that support to enable him to rule the
king. He was a pedant, and lectured the king on his duty like
a schoolmaster. Bute stood in his way as the king's ally and
secret counsellor. His victory over him was partial and short-lived.
While Bute was in the country the king corresponded
with him, and he returned to London in the spring of 1764.
His return made the ministers uneasy, and Grenville's lectures
became intolerable. "When he has wearied me for two hours,"
George complained, "he looks at his watch to see if he may
not tire me for an hour more." Bad as their public conduct was,
he and his colleagues owed their fall chiefly to their unbecoming
behaviour to their sovereign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE REGENCY BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_48" id="TOPIC_48"></a>Early in 1765 the king had a severe illness and showed signs
of the insanity from which he suffered later. He recovered in
March, and as he believed that his life was not likely to be
prolonged, he was anxious to provide for a possible regency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Constitutional usage pointed to the queen as the proper person
to be regent during the infancy of her son. George, however,
wished to have the power to nominate a regent by an instrument
revocable at pleasure. Grenville dissuaded him from this idea,
and, with his ministers' consent, he announced from the throne
that a bill would be laid before parliament restricting the regency
to the queen and other members of the royal family usually
residing in England. When the bill was proposed in the lords
the question was raised whether the king's mother was a member
of the royal family, or only those in the order of succession. If
the Princess of Wales became regent, Bute would probably regain
power. In order to prevent this dire possibility, Bedford
sacrificed decency and common sense by successfully opposing
a motion that the princess's name should expressly be included
in the bill. While the matter was pending, on May 3, Halifax
and Sandwich went to the king and persuaded him that the bill
would not pass the commons unless the princess was excluded.
Anxious to save his mother from insult, George authorised
Halifax to move an amendment that only the queen and those
descended from George II. should be capable of the regency.
Halifax, in moving the amendment, announced that he did so
with the king's sanction, and it was adopted by the lords.</p>

<p>George soon learnt that he had been deceived, that people
were scandalised at his appearing to cast a slur upon his mother,
and that the opposition in the commons would move to include
her name. In great agitation he appealed to Grenville to help
him by announcing a message from the crown to the commons
recommending the inclusion of the princess. Grenville, though
he had had no part in the trick of the two secretaries, refused
his request on the ground that it would stultify the ministers,
nor would he give way though the king actually wept with
mortification. An amendment to insert the princess's name was
proposed in the commons, was carried by 167 votes to 37, and
was accepted by the lords. George determined to shake off
Grenville's yoke. He called on his uncle, Cumberland, to find
him new ministers, and the duke, though he had been treated
unkindly by his nephew, loyally came to his help. Evidently by
Bute's advice, the king authorised him to treat with Pitt and
Temple. Pitt was living in retirement, and in October, 1764,
told Newcastle that he intended to remain unconnected. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was willing to accept office in a comprehensive administration
on the understanding that the officers who had been dismissed
for their votes in parliament should be restored, that the new
ministers should be at liberty to propose a resolution declaring
general warrants illegal, and that a continental alliance should
be formed against the Bourbon powers.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_49" id="TOPIC_49"></a>Temple, however, refused office, and Pitt would not come in
without him. As Temple was on the eve of a reconciliation with
his brother Grenville, with whom he had quarrelled over the
Wilkes affair, it was thought that his refusal was due to an ambitious
idea of a family administration of himself, his brothers,
and Pitt. Be this as it may, he probably suspected that Bute
would have an influence in the proposed administration. Pitt
allowed himself to be swayed by gratitude for help which
Temple had given him in the days of his poverty. During this
negotiation a riot broke out in London. The silk manufacture
was depressed owing to foreign competition, and thousands were
consequently almost starving. A bill to check the importation
of silk by the imposition of fresh duties was laid before the
lords; it was opposed by Bedford, who was averse from restraints
on commerce, and it was rejected. On this a large
number of Spitalfields weavers went to Richmond, on May 14,
to seek help from the king in person. They met him on
Wimbledon common. He received them kindly, but could not,
of course, give them the help they wanted. The next day many
thousands gathered in Spitalfields and Moorfields at beat of
drum, marched to St. James's and Westminster, and stopped
members on their way to parliament. Bedford was assaulted
and wounded, and on the 17th a determined attack was made
upon his house on the north side of Bloomsbury Square. It
was garrisoned by soldiers and others, but the attack was only
defeated by the arrival of fresh troops. When the disturbances
were at last quelled, a large collection was made for the relief of
the immediate distress, which was further mitigated by a sudden
fall in the price of bread.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The affair increased the king's discontent
with his ministers and embittered the feelings of anger
between the Bute and Bedford factions.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FIRST ROCKINGHAM MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_50" id="TOPIC_50"></a>On Pitt's refusal to take office, Cumberland tried Lord
Lyttelton and Charles Townshend, but they declined the king's
offer because they believed that no strong administration was
possible without Pitt. George was forced to beg his ministers
to continue. They took full advantage of his humiliation. Pitt
had asked for assurances on matters of public policy; they made
stipulations which chiefly concerned persons. The king must
promise never again to consult Bute, and must deprive his
brother Mackenzie of the office of privy seal of Scotland. As
regards Bute, George at once gave the required promise, and
though he was afterwards constantly suspected of consulting
with him, there is good reason to believe that he loyally kept
his word, and that Bute never again offered him any advice.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
He had promised Mackenzie his office for life, and declared
"that he should disgrace himself" if he took it from him.
Nevertheless Grenville forced him to give way. His relations
with his ministers were naturally strained; they complained
that he did not support them, and on one occasion Bedford
remonstrated with him in insolent terms. Again George requested
Cumberland to treat with Pitt, who had two interviews
with the king and was anxious to accept his offer, but Temple
peremptorily refused to take any office, even the treasury, and
Pitt with deep regret again followed his lead. The king found
no way of escape, save by authorising Cumberland to turn to the
great whig families. Grenville was dismissed, and an administration
formed under the leadership of the Marquis of Rockingham
took office on July 16. It must have been a bitter
humiliation to George after all that had passed. Yet, though
for the moment he was defeated, he did not mean to give over
the rule of his kingdom to the whigs, and for the present anything
was better than Grenville's tyranny. George respected
his character, but said he, "I would rather see the devil in my
closet than Mr. Grenville".</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_51" id="TOPIC_51"></a>The weakness of the Rockingham administration was patent
from the first. Charles Townshend, who succeeded Holland as
paymaster, called it "a lutestring ministry, fit only for summer
wear"; Pitt was expected to supply one of more durable
material before the winter. The old phalanx of the whigs, tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
hands at political business, was broken up by death and desertion;
their successors lacked experience and authority. Rockingham,
a man of thirty-five, a prominent figure on the turf, of
vast wealth and irreproachable character, was a wretched speaker,
and had neither genius, knowledge, nor industry. The Duke of
Grafton, the secretary of state for the northern department, was
even younger, and, like Rockingham, a great racing man. His
public spirit made him a politician, but he cared so much more
for pleasure than for politics that he was apt to be content so
long as any immediate difficulty was tided over, and he suffered
in public estimation from the scandal caused by his dissolute
life. The southern department was taken by Conway. Dowdeswell,
the chancellor of the exchequer, was a sound financier,
but a dull man. Newcastle, who was privy seal and again had
charge of church patronage, was no longer so powerful as in
earlier days. Nor were the ministers unanimous in feeling. Grafton
was far more at one with Pitt than with the Rockingham
party; and the chancellor (Henley) Lord Northington, Egmont
the first lord of the admiralty, and Barrington the secretary-at-war
were included to please the king. Another cause of weakness
was George's notorious dislike of his new ministers, which
encouraged his "friends," the court party, to intrigue against
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT ON COLONIAL TAXATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_52" id="TOPIC_52"></a>Most serious of all was the attitude of Pitt. He was pressed
to join the government; its policy was in many respects such
as he could approve, and in other matters he could almost have
made his own terms. Nevertheless he refused to take office and
openly declared his lack of confidence in the ministers, though
they tried to satisfy him in various ways, such as by obtaining a
peerage for Pratt, who was created Baron Camden. Magnificent
as he had shown himself as a dictator, he was unfitted by
temperament to work with others, and his natural defects were
aggravated by his constant attacks of gout. At the same time
his present attitude was to a large extent also a matter of principle.
He would willingly have taken office if he could have
simply been the king's minister, unconnected, without belonging
to any party. The Rockinghams, as they were called, were a
party connexion, and under Rockingham's leadership would
remain so, and their character was emphasised by the inclusion
of Newcastle, the chief representative of a system which Pitt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hated, government based on the influence of the whig houses
and not on the good-will of the crown and the people. Pitt
plainly declared that he would not sit at council with Newcastle.
Nor would he take office under Rockingham. Without him the
ministry had neither an original policy nor a chance of permanence.
Called into existence by Cumberland, it leant on him
for support; he was present at all cabinet meetings, and they
were sometimes held at his house. His sudden death on
October 31 was a severe shock to the stability of the government.
Pitt would not advise the ministers. Grafton urged that
he should again be invited to take office, but the king would not
enter on a fresh negotiation with him, for he had refused his
former overtures and held very different views from his regarding
the American stamp act.</p>

<p>For months the ministers paid no heed to American discontent,
save that Conway wrote rather feebly to some of the
colonial governors with reference to the disorders. Parliament
was not summoned until December 17, and though the king's
speech directed attention to the late occurrences in the colonies,
the ministers had not decided on a policy. They ascertained
Pitt's opinion, and so gained a lead. When parliament assembled
in January, 1766, after the recess, Pitt spoke warmly
against any attempt to enforce the stamp act. He avowed his
distrust of the government in a characteristic fashion: "Pardon
me, gentlemen," said he, bowing towards the ministers, "confidence
is a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom; youth is
the season of credulity". He thought that he saw "traces of
an overruling influence," a dark saying which probably referred
to Newcastle.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> While he asserted the sovereignty of Great
Britain over the colonies in legislation, he maintained that
parliament had no right to tax them; taxation, according to
him, was "no part of the governing or legislative power". He
regarded the tax as an infringement of constitutional liberty,
and rejoiced that the Americans had resisted it. Such a matter,
he urged, was not to be decided by text-books; he had not
come down to the house "armed with the statute-book, doubled
down with dog's-ears, to defend the cause of liberty". America
might be crushed, but if she fell, she would fall like Samson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
embracing and pulling down the pillars of the state, the constitution,
along with her. Let them bind her commerce and
restrict her manufactures, but abstain from demanding money
without the consent of her people. His words had a great
effect; they put enforcement out of the question.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_53" id="TOPIC_53"></a>A few days later Edmund Burke made his first speech in
parliament, recommending the house to receive a petition from
the colonies, and was at once recognised as a new power. He
was an Irishman, and was already known as a writer. He
became Rockingham's secretary in 1765, and a seat was provided
for him. Unsurpassed in his mastery of English prose,
he exhibits to the full the splendour of the English language
in his speeches and pamphlets. Nor is his thought unworthy
of the gorgeous attire with which it is invested. His power
and constant habit of discerning and expounding the principles
which were involved in questions of the moment, give him a
supreme place as a teacher of political wisdom. In character
he was pure, generous, and tender-hearted. His fervid imagination
extended the area of his sympathies, and sometimes prejudiced
his opinions. As a speaker he was eloquent, and now
and again carried his audience completely with him, but he
never caught the tone of the house of commons; his longer
speeches were too much of the nature of exhaustive treatises
to be acceptable to its members; he had little tact, an impatient
temper, and often spoke with execrable taste. The chief
article in his political creed was his belief in the excellence of
the constitution. He was an ardent reformer of abuses, but
with the constitution itself he would have no meddling. Unlike
Pitt, he saw that the only effectual check to corrupt influence
was to be found in government by a party united for the promotion
of national interests upon some common principle. Such
a party might, he believed, be based on the whig families, if
only they would keep themselves free from court intrigue and
selfish jealousies. He was a whig of a different type from Newcastle
and Bedford; he built his hopes on the Rockinghams and
inspired their policy. That he never sat in a cabinet was chiefly
because in those days such a distinction was confined to men of
higher birth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REPEAL OF THE STAMP ACT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_54" id="TOPIC_54"></a>Decided action with regard to America was a pressing necessity.
The measures of retaliation adopted by the colonists were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
depressing trade at home. Petitions against the stamp act were
presented from the merchants of London, Liverpool, Glasgow,
and other towns, setting forth the loss inflicted on manufacturers
and their work-people by the stoppage of the American trade,
and the difficulties arising from the non-payment of debts due
from America, which amounted to &pound;4,000,000. The ministers
resolved on the repeal of the act, and on a bill declaring the
right of parliament to legislate for the colonies on all matters
whatsoever. Some of the king's household having voted against the
government, Rockingham went to the king to remonstrate with
him. George told him that he was for repeal, and that Rockingham
might say so. Two days later the ministers heard that
Lord Strange, one of the court party, was saying that the king
was against repeal, and wished it to be known. This made a
great stir, and the "ministerial lives were thought not worth
three days' purchase". Rockingham went to the king for an
explanation. George acknowledged that he had told him that
he was for repeal, but said that they had been speaking only of
the choice between the repeal and the enforcement of the act,
that of the two he was for repeal, but that he desired that the
act should be modified and not repealed. The ministers had
therefore "to carry on a great public measure against the king's
declared sentiments, and with a great number of his servants
acting against them".<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Nevertheless the bill for the repeal of the
act was carried in the commons on March 11 by 275 votes to
167, and a week later in the lords by 105 to 71. It was a signal
victory; but, apart from the interests of commerce, it was due
rather to Pitt than to the government. The declaratory bill
also passed; its chief opponents being Pitt and, in the upper
house, Lord Camden, who on this question, as well as on that of
repeal, talked much trash about a fundamental law of nature
and the limits of the power of parliament, more in place in the
mouth of an American demagogue than of an English judge.
An address was also carried recommending that the colonial
governors should be instructed to require compensation to be
made to those who had suffered during the late disturbances.</p>

<p>Both in England and America the repeal of the stamp act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
was hailed with rejoicing. American discontent was hushed,
and the public manifestations of gladness were accompanied by
expressions of loyalty and affection for the mother-country.
The colonists, however, knew that they had won a victory over
parliament, and they did not forget it. Their substantial grievance,
the commercial regulations, still remained; they soon saw
that they must go further, and that Pitt's distinction between a
direct money-tax and duties on merchandise, though it had
served their immediate purpose, would no longer be useful.
The declaratory act was regarded as a menace, and kept alive
their feelings of suspicion and irritation. Their temper was
shown by the delay of many of the colonies to vote the required
compensation. In Massachusetts, where the vote was passed in
December, it was insolently accompanied by a vote of indemnity
to all concerned in the riots. The repeal of the stamp act needs
no defence; a mistake had been made which was leading to
serious consequences, and in such a case it is a statesmanlike
policy to retrace the false step. The declaratory act was passed
to save the dignity of parliament. In spite of Burke's admiration
for this act, it may be suggested that the assertion of a
right by a party which at the same time declines to enforce it, is
neither a dignified nor a wise proceeding. Its only, and sufficient
defence is that without it the repeal of the tax would have
been impossible. The Americans' denial of the right of parliament,
accompanied as it was by violence of word and action,
roused much indignation in England and involved every supporter
of the repeal in the imputation of betraying its dignity. If repeal
was to be carried it was necessary to satisfy men's minds by a
declaration of the right of parliament to tax the colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CHATHAM MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_55" id="TOPIC_55"></a>Some good work was done in other directions; the cider-tax
was repealed, a commercial treaty was made with Russia,
and the house of commons came into agreement with the judges
on the question of general warrants by resolving that general
warrants being illegal, except in the cases provided for by act of
parliament, the arrest of any of its members on such a warrant
would be a breach of privilege. The administration, however,
was enfeebled by the unconcealed dislike of the king, the hostility
of Pitt, and the general belief that it was keeping him out of
office. Pitt was extremely anxious for office, but would not
accept it unless a "transposition of offices" was made; unless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in fact, Rockingham was got rid of. To this Rockingham would
not consent; he wanted Pitt to take office as his ally, not as his
successor. There were differences in the cabinet on the matter.
The king's section wished to gain Pitt for their master; Rockingham
was upheld by his friends; Grafton wanted Pitt as prime
minister, and Conway, though less decided, agreed with him.
Pitt became querulous and unreasonable, and in April violently
attacked the ministers, specially excepting Grafton and Conway.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
All attempts at negotiation having failed, Grafton made his
choice for Pitt and resigned office. It was not easy to fill his
place, for the ministry was regarded as moribund, and finally
the king was forced to give the seals to Rockingham's friend,
the young Duke of Richmond. The chancellor, Northington, a
strong supporter of the king, saw that the end was not far off,
and apparently determined to make sure of a place in the next
administration by sacrificing his colleagues. He quarrelled with
them in the cabinet on a question relating to the administration
of law in Canada, and early in July told the king that he must
resign office, and that the ministry was too weak to go on.
George eagerly seized the opportunity for getting rid of it and
replacing it by a more comprehensive ministry with Pitt at its
head. The difficulties which had stood in Pitt's way were removed;
the American question seemed to be settled; he had
made it known that he would not again be guided by Temple, and
he was delighted to be the king's minister, avowing his determination
"to defend the closet against every contending party"&mdash;against,
that is, the great whig houses and their connexions.</p>

<p>The satisfaction consequent on Pitt's accession to power
faded at the news that he had accepted a peerage as Earl of
Chatham. It was unjustly considered as a bribe, and lost him
much of his popularity. A more serious consequence was that
it left the leadership of the house of commons to weaker hands.
Though prime minister, he took for himself the unimportant
office of privy seal. His course was probably determined by
a consciousness of failing health. Conway became northern
secretary of state, with the leadership of the commons, and
Shelburne secretary for the southern department. In spite of
Temple's opposition to the repeal of the stamp act, Pitt offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
him the treasury, but that vain man would not enter the cabinet
except as Pitt's equal, and a quarrel ensued between them. The
treasury was then accepted by Grafton; and, unfortunately, by
his advice, Charles Townshend was made chancellor of the
exchequer. Camden was appointed chancellor, Northington
president of the council, and they, with Granby as commander-in-chief,
and Sir Charles Saunders, who succeeded Egmont at
the admiralty, completed the cabinet. Besides Conway and
Saunders, some other Rockinghams had inferior offices, but
Rockingham himself and most of his party considered that
Chatham had treated them badly, and repelled his advances.
The ministry was unfortunate in being represented in the house
of commons by the irresolute Conway and the unprincipled
Townshend. Worse still, Chatham, whose arrogance increased
with his disease, alienated adherents, and treated his colleagues
with reserve and disdain.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_56" id="TOPIC_56"></a>Chatham at once pursued the foreign policy which he had
consistently recommended by seeking a continental alliance to
counterbalance the alliance of the Bourbon powers. The family
compact did not lose its importance at the peace of Paris.
Choiseul in France and Grimaldi, who succeeded Wall in Spain,
worked together heartily in promoting a Bourbon policy, and
looked forward to the reconquest of the lost possessions of
France and Spain. The allies were strengthened by the good-will
of Austria. Schemes of aggrandisement were formed, which
included the acquisition of Corsica by France and of Portugal
by Spain. There were unsettled causes of dispute between them
and England touching the fortification of Dunkirk and the
Manila ransom, and Spain was also aggrieved by a British
settlement in the Falkland islands. Against France the natural
ally of England was Russia, for she had a strong interest in
opposing French influence in Denmark and Sweden; while on
the side of England a Russian alliance would, in the event of
war, secure her Baltic trade and enable her fleet to act elsewhere,
and would be a defence for Hanover. An alliance with Russia
had already been discussed, but Catherine II. had far less interest
in the matter than England, and insisted that any alliance should
include her Turkish war, to which England would not consent.
Catherine was in alliance with Frederick of Prussia, and Chatham,
hoping that the adhesion of England would be welcomed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
designed a defensive alliance between Great Britain, Prussia, and
Russia, which might take in Denmark, Sweden, the States-General,
and any other power interested in withstanding Bourbon
aggrandisement. To Catherine her alliance with Prussia was
much more important than anything which she could obtain
from England, and Chatham's design therefore depended on
Frederick's good-will. He declined the proposal of Great Britain:
he had not forgiven the ill-treatment which he believed he had
received from Bute; he admired Chatham, but had no assurance
that he would remain in power; and he considered any possible
danger to himself from the Bourbon alliance to be too remote to
make it advisable for him to join in a concert to prevent it. He
was already meditating the partition of Poland, and the proposed
combination would have been contrary to his policy. Chatham's
great design was consequently defeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHATHAM'S DIFFICULTIES.</i></div>

<p>His arbitrary temper soon brought him into difficulties. He
desired to reward a new adherent with the office of treasurer of
the household, then held by Lord Edgcumbe, and on Edgcumbe's
refusal to vacate the office, he deprived him of it. Edgcumbe
was connected with the Rockingham party, and, with the exception
of Conway, all the more important members of it who
had joined the new ministry, the Duke of Portland, Saunders,
and others, resigned office. Conway was almost persuaded to
follow their example, for Chatham treated him with haughty
coldness, but he yielded to the urgent advice of his friend Horace
Walpole, and remained in the ministry, uneasy and vacillating.
Any alliance with the Rockinghams being out of the question,
Chatham was driven to make overtures to the Bedford party,
which failed because they asked more than he would grant.
Finally, Saunders's place at the admiralty was supplied by the
famous admiral, Sir Edward Hawke, and the other vacancies
were filled by tories and courtiers.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_57" id="TOPIC_57"></a>The harvest of 1765 was bad, and that of the present year
promised to be no better. The price of wheat rose rapidly, and
in July reached 44s. a quarter. The poor were distressed,
worse times seemed to be ahead, and the dealers were believed
to be keeping back supplies in the expectation of higher prices.
Riots of a more or less serious character broke out in some fifty
places; bakers' shops were pillaged, mills and barns were fired,
and dealers and tradesmen were forced to sell provisions at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
prices fixed by the people. It was not until September 10, when
wheat had again risen, that the ministers, in accordance with
the economic ideas of the time, issued a proclamation against
forestalling and engrossing. It had no effect; the price reached
49s., and on the 26th the council laid an embargo on exportation.
By law the ministers had no right to take such a step until
wheat was at 53s. 4d. As, however, prices were rising, all parties
agreed that the embargo was in itself a justifiable measure.
It was, however, objected that the ministers should have summoned
parliament to meet at an earlier date, and have acted
with its authority. When parliament met on November 11,
the opposition insisted that the ministers needed a bill of indemnity
for having set aside the law by a proclamation of
council. Chatham defended their action on the constitutional
ground of necessity. His colleagues and supporters were not
all equally wise. Northington declared that the proclamation
was legally, as well as morally, justifiable; and the chancellor,
Camden, the assertor of popular liberties, that "it was at most
a forty days' tyranny". His foolish speech was severely handled
by Mansfield. In the commons Alderman Beckford, a hot-headed
admirer of Chatham, said that "if the public was in
danger the king had a dispensing power," and was forced by
Grenville to retract his words. The debates on this matter
injured the reputation of the ministry though they did not
endanger its stability.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REVOLT IN BENGAL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_58" id="TOPIC_58"></a>When parliament rose in December Chatham went to Bath
for the sake of his health. In February, 1767, he had a severe
attack of gout, and in March the disease began to affect his
mental powers. For the next two years he was unable to take
any part in politics. His effacement left the ministry without
a head. Before his retirement a difference arose in the cabinet
on the affairs of the East India Company. From a simple
trading company it had been raised by the victories of Clive
and his generals to the position of a territorial power. Its
affairs were managed by a court of directors elected annually,
and consequently under the control of the court of proprietors
in which every holder of &pound;500 stock had a vote. It proved
itself unequal to its new position. Clive returned to England
in 1760, the possessor of a princely fortune, and in 1762 was
created Baron Clive of Plassey in the Irish peerage. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
opposed in the court of directors by a party headed by Sullivan.
In India he was succeeded by Vansittart, and there troubles
soon arose, chiefly from the greed of the company's servants.
M&iacute;r Jafar, the Naw&aacute;b of Bengal, a self-indulgent and unpopular
ruler, was deposed by the council in 1761, and his son-in-law,
M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim, was made naw&aacute;b in his place. It was a profitable
business, for M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim spent &pound;200,000 in presents to the
council and ceded to the company the revenues of three districts,
amounting to some &pound;500,000 a year. Yet the exchange of
naw&aacute;bs proved an unwise step, for M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim was able and
active. He moved his court from Murshid&aacute;b&aacute;d to Monghyr,
at a greater distance from Calcutta, organised an army, and
showed that he was ready to resist oppression.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_59" id="TOPIC_59"></a>The revenues of the Indian princes were largely derived
from tolls on the transit of merchandise. The company, which
had the right of free exportation and importation, passed its
goods free inland under the certificate of the head of a factory.
The system was abused. The company paid its servants
insufficient salaries, and they made up for it by engaging in
private inland trade, using the company's passes to cover their
goods. Armed with its power, they forced the natives to deal
with their native agents, to buy dear and sell cheap; they
monopolised the trade in the necessaries of life, and grew rich
upon the miseries of the helpless people. Private trade and
extorted presents enabled many a man who as a mere youth
had obtained a writer's place to return to England after a few
years with a handsome income. M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim saw his people
starving, his officers ill-treated, and his treasury robbed, and
prepared for revolt. Conscious of the impending danger, Vansittart
made an agreement with him as to tolls. The council at
Calcutta indignantly repudiated the agreement, and M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim
was furious. Open hostilities began in June, 1763. One of the
council, who was sent on an embassy to K&aacute;sim, was killed by
his troops. Patn&aacute; was seized by the English; it was retaken,
and some 200 English were made prisoners. A little army
under Major Adams, routed the naw&aacute;b's forces, and on October
11 Monghyr was taken. M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim caused all his prisoners, save
five, to be massacred, and fled for refuge to Shuj&aacute;-ud-Daul&aacute; the
naw&aacute;b waz&iacute;r of Oudh. Patn&aacute; was taken by storm and Bengal
was completely subdued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_60" id="TOPIC_60"></a>M&iacute;r Jafar was again made naw&aacute;b, and paid large sums
both to the company and its servants as compensation for their
losses. The war, however, was not over, for the naw&aacute;b waz&iacute;r
espoused the cause of M&iacute;r K&aacute;sim, and, in conjunction with the
Mughal emperor, Sh&aacute;h Alam, threatened Bengal. Major Hector
Munro took command of the British army, and found it in a
mutinous condition; desertions to the enemy were frequent.
He captured a large body of deserters, caused twenty-four of
the ringleaders to be blown from guns, and by his dauntless
conduct restored discipline among the troops. With about
7,000 men, of whom only some 1,000 were Europeans, he
inflicted a crushing defeat on the allied forces, 50,000 strong,
at Bax&aacute;r on October 23, 1764. The enemy lost 6,000 men
and 167 guns. Oudh lay at the disposal of the English, and
Sh&aacute;h Alam sought refuge with the conquerors. Early in
1765 M&iacute;r Jafar died, and the council at Calcutta, without
consulting the emperor, appointed his son to succeed him,
receiving in presents from him &pound;139,357, besides money unaccounted
for. These revolutions and wars cost the company
much money, and, while its servants were enriching themselves,
it incurred heavy debts. Clive was called upon to put an end
to the maladministration of Bengal. He refused to return to
India while Sullivan was chairman of the court of directors.
After a sharp contest, in which large sums were spent, the
proprietors put his party in power. He was invested with full
authority as commander-in-chief and governor of Bengal to act
in conjunction with a select committee.</p>

<p>He landed in India in May, 1765. During his administration
of about eighteen months he secured for the company the
virtual sovereignty over its conquests without dispossessing the
nominal rulers, and he took measures for the reformation of the
company's service. Averse from a forward policy of conquest,
he restored Oudh to the naw&aacute;b waz&iacute;r on payment of &pound;500,000.
Allah&aacute;b&aacute;d and Kora were assigned to the emperor, together
with a tribute from Bengal, and in return Sh&aacute;h Alam granted
to the company the right of levying and administering the
revenues of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, together with jurisdiction
in the Northern Circars. The naw&aacute;b of Bengal received an
annual pension of &pound;600,000, and surrendered all his power to
the company, except the right of criminal jurisdiction. Clive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
reorganised the army, and stopped the double <i>batta</i>, or allowance,
granted by M&iacute;r Jafar after the battle of Plassey. He
forbade illicit trade and the receipt of presents, and secured
the company's servants increased salaries. These reforms were
effected in the face of violent opposition, both in civil and
military quarters. Two hundred officers conspired to resign
their commissions on the same day. Clive faced the mutiny
successfully; he cashiered the leaders and accepted the submission
of the younger men. Ill-health obliged him to return
to England in January, 1767.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AFFAIRS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_61" id="TOPIC_61"></a>The enormous private fortunes made in India led people to
believe that the company was far richer than it really was.
During the late wars the dividend was 6 per cent. In 1766 the
proprietors urged an increase. To this the directors objected
that the debts of the company were heavy, and that a premature
increase would raise the price of stock to a point at which
it could not be maintained, and might end in a disaster like that
of the South Sea Company. The ministers sent a message of
warning, announcing that the affairs of the company would probably
be considered in parliament. They concerned the public,
for the company enjoyed protection and privileges granted by
the nation. Nevertheless the proprietors carried their point,
and a dividend of 10 per cent. was declared. Chatham held that
the time had come for parliament to inquire by what right the
company administered its territorial revenues. He considered
that it had no right to its new position of a virtually sovereign
power, that the sovereignty of the crown should be asserted,
and that in return for the privileges which it enjoyed it should
contribute a portion of its revenues to the national treasury.
The company should apply to parliament to make good its
defective title, and parliament should then settle what portion of
its revenues should be assigned to it by way of favour. His
ideas were based on an imperial policy. As early as 1759 he
held that the territorial acquisitions of the company should be
claimed for the nation. With him it was a matter not merely of
revenue but of government, and though his ideas are indistinctly
indicated, and were perhaps vaguely formed, it is probable that
he had in his mind some idea of making the government of
India an imperial matter. Yet, sharing as he did the general
belief as to the wealth of the company, he certainly attached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
much importance to the possibility of obtaining from it an increase
of the public revenue.</p>

<p>A special reason may be discerned for his desire to obtain
such an increase at the end of 1766. The government wanted
money; there was a heavy debt on the civil list, and the navy
needed a large grant. An increase of taxation was inadvisable,
for corn was dear. Various schemes for the increase of revenue
were in the air. Many members of parliament, the court party,
the country interest, and the Grenville and Bedford connexions
were regretting the repeal of the stamp act. "We must look to
the East and not to the West," wrote Beckford to Chatham,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and
he spoke the mind of his leader. The cabinet was divided.
Grafton and Shelburne agreed with Chatham that the question
of the company's rights should be decided by parliament.
Townshend declared that it would be "absurd" to force the
company to share its power with the crown, and both he and
Conway desired that the question of right should be waived
and that its relations with the government should be settled
by amicable arrangement. In May, 1767, the proprietors insisted
on a dividend at the rate of 12&frac12; per cent. A motion was
carried to bring the affairs of the company before parliament.
Townshend, as Chatham said, "marred the business"; he
managed to open the door for negotiation, and to make it a
mere matter of money. In June, 1767, a bill was passed, based
on an agreement with the company, which in return for the confirmation
of its territorial revenues, bound itself to pay the government
&pound;400,000 a year for two years; and parliament prohibited
a higher dividend than 10 per cent. The bill was violently
opposed, specially by the Rockingham party, on the ground
that it was an unjustifiable interference with the rights of property.
In 1769 the agreement with the company was renewed,
and permission was given for a dividend of 12&frac12; per cent, on
certain conditions. The company was then in debt over
&pound;6,000,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HAIDAR AL&Iacute;.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_62" id="TOPIC_62"></a>A new and formidable enemy had arisen in Southern India.
In 1767 Haidar (Hyder) Al&iacute;, the ruler of Mysore, made war
upon the English in conjunction with the Niz&aacute;m of Haidar&aacute;b&aacute;d.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
The allies were defeated, and the niz&aacute;m made peace. Haidar,
however, continued the war. He had a large force of cavalry
which he brought to great perfection, and, as the English were
deficient in that arm, he was able to do much mischief in the
Karnatic. In April, 1769, having previously drawn the English
army away from Madras by skilful man&oelig;uvres, he suddenly
appeared in the immediate neighbourhood of the town. The
English were forced to make a treaty with him on his own
terms. The news sent the company's stock down 60 per cent.
The same year the crops failed in Bengal, and in 1770 there was
a grievous famine which is said to have carried off a third of
the inhabitants. Yet in spite of the decreasing revenue and the
heavy debts of the company, the proprietors were receiving
dividends of 12 and 12&frac12; per cent.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>GROWTH OF THE KING'S POWER.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_63" id="TOPIC_63"></a>While Chatham was suffering from gout and Conway from
indecision, Townshend had opportunities for mischief. His
brilliant wit and oratory gave him extraordinary influence in
the house of commons, which he used merely for his own ends,
for he was unprincipled and greedy for popularity. Whatever
it might be that the majority in the house wished to have
done, he was anxious to be the doer of it. This desire to
lead the house by carrying out its wishes was probably the true
reason of his opposition to Chatham's Indian policy. It led
him to take a more disastrous line with reference to America.
The colonies were irritated and suspicious. Massachusetts was
encroaching on the royal prerogative by passing an amnesty
bill, and was quarrelling over it with its governor, Bernard, and
the New York assembly was defying the authority of parliament
by refusing to provide the troops with certain articles specified
in the mutiny act. An equally unconciliatory spirit prevailed
in England, where the repeal of the stamp act had become
unpopular. It was necessary to keep a permanent force in
America, and the colonists should have been willing to contribute
to the defence of the empire by paying for it. Their
refusal was attributed to a desire to save their pockets, which
to some extent was the case, and Englishmen were angry at the
prospect of being called upon to meet expenses which should
have been borne by others. Even warm friends of the colonies
held that a military establishment should be paid for out of
colonial revenues, and Shelburne was considering how a fund
might be raised without taxation.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Unfortunately, Townshend
chose to pander to the feelings of the majority of the commons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
In a debate on the army supplies on January 26, 1767, he
boasted, without any previous consultation with his fellow-ministers,
that he could raise a revenue from America nearly
sufficient to maintain the troops there. The house received
his words with applause, his colleagues with dumb dismay.
Grenville and Lord George Sackville took them up and forced
him to pledge himself to make them good.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AMERICAN REVENUE ACTS.</i></div>

<p>Money was wanted for the service of the country, and
specially for the maintenance of the navy, and a month later
Townshend proposed that the land tax should be continued at
four shillings in the pound. A strong opposition was expected,
for the country gentlemen reasonably contended that the tax
had been raised from three to four shillings as a war-tax,
that it was time to lower it, and that if the stamp act had
not been repealed it might be reduced to its normal amount.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The whigs, whose economic policy was directed by their
desire to increase the wealth and power of the nation by
promoting trade, held that the larger share of taxation should
be drawn from the land, and fostered the agricultural interest in
order to enable it to bear the disproportionate burden they laid
upon it. Nevertheless, the Rockingham and Grenville parties
took advantage of the dissatisfaction of the landed gentry, acted
together in a factious spirit, and defeated the government proposal
by 206 votes to 188. This was a serious blow to the
government, and was the first occasion on which a minister had
been defeated on a money-bill since the revolution. The defeat
was due to Townshend's neglect. Chatham would no longer
bear with him, and one of his last acts before his retirement
was to invite Lord North, the eldest son of the Earl of Guilford,
to take his place as chancellor of the exchequer. North refused,
and Townshend remained in office. He had to raise money
somehow, and he was kept in mind of his pledge with regard to
America; for parliament was indignant at the conduct of the
New York assembly, and the court party urged him on by
representing that the king was humiliated by the repeal of the
stamp act. In June he carried two bills affecting the colonies,
one providing for the execution of the trade laws, the other
imposing duties on the importation of glass, paper, paints, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
tea. The produce of these duties was to be applied, first, to the
cost of administering justice and of the civil government, and
the surplus was to be paid into the exchequer and appropriated
by parliament to the defence of the colonies. The bills passed
without opposition and the acts came into operation on November
20. A bill was also passed suspending the legislative
power of the New York assembly, until it should comply with
the mutiny act.</p>

<p>The new duties were external taxes, taxes on trade, such as
the colonists had professed themselves prepared to pay, and
they were trifling in amount, their produce being estimated at
less than &pound;40,000. But they were imposed for purposes of
revenue, not for the regulation of trade, which would in Chatham's
eyes have rendered them a rightful imposition. And the
colonists' position had changed. They demanded to be taxed
only by their own assemblies, and regarded the new acts as laying
the foundation of a fiscal system which would probably be
as liable to abuse as the Irish civil list. A renewal of the
rumour concerning a colonial episcopate increased their suspicion
as to the height to which demands on their purse might grow.
Their discontent was originally founded on their impatience of
control and on the restraints placed upon their industry and
commerce; their resistance was roused by the fear of future ill-government
rather than by actual grievances. The quarrel
became embittered by faults on both sides. By denying the
authority of parliament and contemning the prerogative, the
Americans took up a position which could not be conceded to
them without national humiliation; they irritated the English
by violent words and actions, and treated the loyalists with
injustice and cruelty. On the other hand, England, besides
imposing restrictions on their industry and commerce, made
demands upon them which, though just, were galling to their
spirit. As they had representative assemblies, they argued that
they should be taxed only by their authority. The king and
the nation generally had no sympathy with their complaints and
were unconciliatory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHATHAM'S ILLNESS.</i></div>

<p>Yet while there were faults on both sides, both alike showed
a spirit worthy of their common stock, the colonists by their
insistence on self-government, the mother-country by its steadfast
adherence to the imperial idea as it then existed. Massachusetts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
again took the lead in resistance; the merchants renewed the
non-importation agreements, and the assembly sent a petition to
the king, and on February 11, 1768, a circular letter to the other
provincial assemblies condemning the late acts and inviting
co-operation. This letter, the work of Samuel Adams, did much
to remove the jealousies between the provinces and to arouse
a spirit of union. It evoked expressions of sympathy from
Virginia and other colonies, and the merchants of New York
at once joined the Bostonians in a system of non-importation.
Of almost equal importance were <i>The Farmer's Letters</i> by
Dickinson, which appeared in a Pennsylvania paper in 1767-68,
and contained an able statement of the claims of colonies, recommending
a firm but peaceable attitude of resistance. Meanwhile
the condition of the ministry was unfavourable alike to any
chance of conciliation or to a consistently vigorous policy.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_64" id="TOPIC_64"></a>George was grievously disappointed by Chatham's illness.
Between them they had put together an administration which
Burke aptly compared to a piece of mosaic, formed of men of
various parties; and with it George not unreasonably hoped to
be able to carry out his ideal system of government, to destroy
party distinctions and establish his rule over his people for their
benefit and with their good-will.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In Chatham's absence, Grafton
became his principal minister, though he had no authority in
the cabinet. For a time Chatham's speedy recovery was expected,
and both the king and Grafton made constant appeals
to him at least to express his opinion on public affairs. No help
was to be had from him; he would only entreat Grafton to
remain in office. The disorganised ministry was confronted by
a strong opposition composed of the Rockingham, Bedford, and
Grenville connexions. Chatham became incapable of transacting
any business; and when it was evident that his illness would
be prolonged, Grafton advised the king to enter into negotiations
with them. In July, 1767, George invited Rockingham to draw
up a plan for an administration. He did not intend to admit
the Rockinghams to office; he wanted a ministry, formed on
non-party lines, which would be strong enough to hold its ground
in parliament, and all he wished Rockingham to do was to submit
a scheme of such a ministry for his approval, including in it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
some of the present ministers. Rockingham, however, held the
modern doctrine that a prime minister should form his own
administration, and assumed that the existing ministry was at
an end.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_65" id="TOPIC_65"></a>He yielded to the king's wish, but was determined not to
take office except with a comprehensive ministry united on the
basis of opposition to that court influence which had wrecked
his former government. With this idea he attempted to form
a union with the Bedford party. The negotiation failed, for
Grenville and Temple, who were then united to the Bedfords,
represented to their allies that no union was possible without
agreement as to American policy. This ended the matter,
for the Grenville and Bedford parties were strongly in favour
of American taxation. Rockingham therefore told the king that
he was unable to act upon his invitation. Grafton remained in
office. A man of pleasure and of culture, in some points a true
descendant of Charles II., he was out of his proper element in
political life. He grudged leaving his kennels at Wakefield
Lodge or the heath at Newmarket to transact public business
in London, and preferred reading a play of Euripides at Euston
to being bored by a debate at Westminster. On no other English
minister have the responsibilities of office had so little effect;
he would put off a cabinet meeting for a race meeting, and even
in the presence of the king and queen appeared at the opera
by the side of his mistress, Nancy Dawson, afterwards Lady
Maynard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ACCESSIONS TO THE MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p>Yet, uncongenial as official work was to him, Grafton was
unwilling to desert the king and disappoint Chatham. He fully
intended to carry out Chatham's policy. He failed to do so, for
he allowed himself to be swayed by the king; and he let things
slide in a wrong direction, because he would not take the trouble
to make any strenuous effort to check their course. In Chatham's
absence the king gradually gained complete control of the ministry,
and on every important question the ministers followed a line
wholly contrary to that which Chatham would have adopted.
Townshend died in September and North became chancellor of
the exchequer. North was an able financier, personally popular,
and a successful leader of the house of commons. He was a
strong tory and was prepared to uphold the king's policy whether
he approved it or not. At the end of the year an agreement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
was made with the Bedford party. The duke, whose sight was
failing and who was mourning the loss of his only surviving
son, would not himself take office, but bade his followers do as
they pleased. Lord Gower became president of the council in
place of Northington; Conway resigned the seals of secretary,
though he remained in the cabinet, and Lord Weymouth was
made secretary of state for the northern department. Lord
Hillsborough was appointed as a third secretary of state for
the colonies which, in consequence of the increase of colonial
business, were removed from Shelburne's department, and other
members of the "Bloomsbury gang" received minor offices.
These changes were held to amount to the formation of a fresh
administration. George did not at first like the junction with
the Bedfords, which seemed contrary to his policy of destroying
connexions, but the new ministers were so ready to carry out all
his wishes that he was soon delighted with them.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_66" id="TOPIC_66"></a>The ministry showed its bias by its action with reference
to a dispute between the two chief magnates in Cumberland
and Westmorland, the Duke of Portland, a prominent member
of the Rockingham party, and Sir James Lowther, Bute's son-in-law,
who commanded nine seats in the house of commons.
The duke's estate in the north came to him by a grant from
William III. to the first Earl of Portland, in virtue of which he
held the forest of Inglewood and the socage of Carlisle, valued
at about &pound;30,000, as appurtenances to the estate expressly
granted. Lowther contended that the grant did not convey
these appurtenances and applied to the treasury for a lease of
them. Without officially informing the duke of his claim,
the treasury granted the lease. As between subject and subject
the duke's title would have been indisputable, for his house
had had undisturbed possession for over sixty years, but as
regards claims of the crown there was an ancient maxim:
<i>Nullum tempus occurrit regi</i>&mdash;"Time does not bar the king's
rights". The attempt of the treasury to revive this maxim
was considered oppressive, and was generally attributed to the
influence of Bute and the court, and to a desire to injure a
political opponent and gratify a powerful supporter. The feeling
was strengthened by the characters of the two disputants, for
Portland was a man of high reputation, Lowther a cynical
tyrant. On February 17, 1768, Sir George Savile, a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Yorkshire landowner and a member of the Rockingham party,
whose integrity and wealth gave him weight in the house,
brought in a bill called the <i>Nullum tempus</i> bill, to make sixty
years' possession a bar to claims of the crown. It was opposed
by the ministry, and North succeeded in adjourning the motion,
though only by 134 to 114. Parliament was dissolved in March,
and the new parliament passed the bill.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_67" id="TOPIC_67"></a>The union with the Bedford party lessened any chance of
American conciliation. Hillsborough ordered the Massachusetts
assembly to rescind its circular letter. It refused, and, acting
on Hillsborough's instructions, Bernard dissolved the assembly.
Other colonies rejected the command to disregard the letter;
they would stand or fall with Massachusetts. In New York,
however, the "whig party" was defeated at the elections, the
assembly complied with the mutiny act, and its legislative
authority was restored. Bernard sent home disquieting reports;
the revenue laws were openly defied, and the officers forcibly
prevented from executing them; he was himself insulted by the
mob, and had not, he wrote, "the shadow of authority". There
were no troops nearer than New York. Bernard, an upright and
fairly able man, though too apt to dispute with his disputatious
opponents, was extremely unpopular, for it was known that he
advised the ministers to take strong measures. It was his duty
to represent the royal authority and to maintain the laws, and
he told them that he could do nothing unless he was supported.
He was right. Between a frank surrender and a vigorous and
consistent policy there should have been no middle way. The
ministers found one. They irritated the Americans without attempting
to crush the fomenters of disturbance; they threatened
and retreated, made a demonstration of force and shrank from
employing it; their threats made the British government hated,
their lenity brought it into contempt.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Bernard, of course, wrote
as a partisan, but with this allowance his reports may be accepted
as trustworthy.</p>

<p>Acting on these reports, Hillsborough, early in June, 1768,
ordered Gage to send troops to Boston to protect the king's
officers. It was full time. On the 10th a sloop belonging
to Hancock, a merchant of Boston, arrived in the harbour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
laden with wine from Madeira. The tide-waiter who boarded
her was forcibly detained, and an attempt was made to defraud
the revenue by a false declaration. On this the commissioners
seized the sloop and laid her under the stem of the <i>Romney</i>, a
man-of-war, in the harbour. A riot ensued; the revenue officers
were mobbed, one of their boats was burned, and they were
forced to take refuge in the castle. On September 29 seven
ships carrying the 14th and 29th regiments, and a company of
artillery, in all about 1,000 men, arrived in the harbour. The
Bostonians refused to assign quarters for the troops, and they
suffered some hardships. On receiving the news of the riot in
June the ministers despatched the 64th and 65th regiments to
Boston. These reinforcements arrived in January, 1769. The
people were indignant; but in the face of so large a force remained
quiet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHATHAM RESIGNS OFFICE.</i></div>

<p>On American, as well as on other measures, Shelburne, who
desired conciliation, differed from his colleagues. In the autumn
of 1768 the king and the Bedford party urged his dismissal, and
Grafton acquiesced. Chatham was annoyed by this decision,
and still more by the dismissal of Sir Jeffrey Amherst, governor
of Virginia. He resigned the privy seal in October, and
Grafton was thenceforward considered as head of the ministry.
A few days later Shelburne resigned. He was generally disliked
and distrusted. He had acted as a go-between in the early
days of his career, and while in office was believed to be false
to his colleagues; his face answered to the popular idea of a
Jesuit, and his manners were artificial. He was given the
nickname of Malagrida, a Portuguese Jesuit who had been
executed for conspiracy in 1761. Weymouth took his place in
the southern, and Lord Rochford became secretary of state for
the northern department. When parliament met in December,
Bedford moved a petition to the crown to apply to Massachusetts
an act of 35 Henry VIII., by which offenders outside the
kingdom were liable to be brought to England for trial. This
motion and eight resolutions on American affairs moved by
Hillsborough passed both houses without a division, though not
without opposition, the cause of the colonists being advocated
in the commons by Pownall, an ex-governor of Massachusetts,
Burke, and others.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_68" id="TOPIC_68"></a>To recommend the revival of an obsolete statute, made in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
tyrannical reign and to meet different circumstances, in order to
enable a government to deport offenders from a distant colony
and try them by juries certain to be prejudiced against them,
was so contrary to the spirit of the constitution as to be
defensible only on the ground of necessity. That it would have
been impossible to secure a verdict in the province against a
rioter can scarcely be doubted. The government, however,
advocated this measure, not because it was necessary, but merely
to frighten the colonists. This became known in America, and
the colonists learned that England had made an empty threat,
and was about to adopt a conciliatory policy. The only effect
of the threat was to excite Virginia and North Carolina to
non-importation. The non-importation agreements, which were
enforced by advertising the names of offending tradesmen,
caused heavy loss to British trade. Between Christmas 1767
and 1769 the value of exports to America decreased by about
&pound;700,000. The cabinet inclined to conciliatory measures, and
the Massachusetts assembly was again summoned, though it
professed no regret for its past conduct. On May 1, 1769, the
cabinet resolved to bring in a bill during the next session for
taking off all the new duties except that on tea. Grafton
proposed to give them all up, and was supported by Camden,
Conway, and Granby. North was inclined to a total repeal, but
yielded to the king's influence, and declared for retaining the
tea duty as a manifestation of right; Gower, Hillsborough,
Weymouth and Rochford voted with him. Grafton, though
outvoted in the cabinet, remained in office; he desired to resign,
but found no "good ground for retirement," for though
the king henceforward dictated his orders to him rather than
asked his advice, he did not, so Grafton writes, withdraw his
personal favour. So completely was the position of a prime
minister of our own day unknown at that time.</p>

<p>Hillsborough informed the colonies of the partial repeal of
the duties, and of the intention of the government not to lay
any further taxes on America for the purpose of revenue. In
its amount, namely, threepence on the pound, the tea duty was
not a grievance, for the duty of one shilling paid in England
was returned on re-exportation, so that the Americans could
buy their tea ninepence per pound cheaper than in England.
The colonial agitators, however, denied the right of taxation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and the authority of parliament, and these the king and the
English people generally were determined to maintain. Hillsborough's
letter was ungracious, but its tone was probably of no
consequence; the quarrel was not of a sort to be allayed by
smooth words. Further attempts at conciliation were made.
In compliance with a petition from Massachusetts, Bernard was
recalled, and his place was taken by Hutchinson. Boston complained
bitterly of the presence of the troops, and half of them
were moved away. So long as the British force was strong the
town was fairly quiet. When it was reduced the people began
to abuse and irritate the soldiers, until the insults heaped upon
them led, as we shall see, to an untoward encounter. Thus did
the ministry strengthen the spirit of resistance and bring contempt
upon Great Britain. For its refusal to make its concessions
complete, the king is mainly responsible. A complete surrender
would have humiliated him and his realm in the eyes of the
world. Whether such humiliation, surely not tamely to be
accepted by a great nation, would in the end have prevented
the Americans from finding cause for quarrel and separation
may possibly be matter for discussion. It is certainly not so
with the policy of the ministers, that, if it can be called a policy
at all, was clearly the worst they could have adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONDITION OF IRELAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_69" id="TOPIC_69"></a>In Irish, not less than in American, affairs the policy of the
ministry was decided by the king. Ireland was governed as a
subject country. Shut out from the benefits of the navigation
laws, she was only allowed such commerce as would not bring
her into rivalry with England. Since the beginning of the
century the condition of her people had slightly improved, but
in Munster and Connaught there was much terrible misery.
Though the severest provisions of the penal code were obsolete,
the protestants still remained a dominant caste. Roman catholics
were shut out from the bar and the army, and the sons of
catholic squires for the most part either spent their youth in
idleness or served in foreign armies. The great landowners
were generally absentees and their estates were rented by
middle-men; the lands were let three or four deep, and the
peasants were crushed by exorbitant rents and unjust dealing.
Their burdens were increased by the tithe paid to an alien
Church which was still rather a secular than a religious power
and, though more Irishmen held preferments in it than formerly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
had no place in the affections of the people and neglected its
duty, while the catholic priests, mostly poor and ignorant men,
were active, were adored by their flocks, and ruled them with
benevolent despotism. The tithe was specially burdensome to
the poor, both because the rich pasture-lands of the wealthy
were exempt from payment, while it was levied on little plots
worked by the plough or spade of the peasant, and because it
was constantly farmed out to men who made their bargains
profitable by oppressing the needy with unfair exactions. Chief
among the causes of the misery of the peasants was the extent
to which arable land was converted into pasture. Commons
were unjustly enclosed, villages were depopulated, the starving
peasants were forced to flee to the mountains, and black cattle
roamed at will round the ruins of their deserted dwellings.</p>

<p>The despair of the wretched found expression in violence.
In 1761 a secret society called the Whiteboys was organised in
Munster and parts of Leinster to resist, or exact vengeance for,
the enclosure of commons, and unjust rents or tithe. The movement
was agrarian, not religious, though the Whiteboys were
catholics, nor political. It was formidable, for there was no
Irish constabulary or militia. The Whiteboys would gather in
obedience to some secret mandate, march by night in large and
ordered companies, some to the land of one offender, others to
that of another, and, making the darkness hideous with their
white smocks, fall to houghing cattle, destroying fences, and
spoiling pastures. Many cruel deeds were done, though the
murders were few. Stern acts were passed against Whiteboyism;
volunteers put themselves at the disposal of the magistrates,
and the rising was at last crushed, not without cruelty and an
unfair administration of the criminal law. The outbreak is a
notable event in Irish history, for from that time until now
secret societies which have attempted to gain their objects by
lawless and bloody means have constantly existed in Ireland.
In protestant Ulster the Oakboys, as they called themselves,
rose in 1763 against an increase in the demands for tithe
and the burdens laid upon them for making and repairing
roads. Their rising was not accompanied by the cruelties which
disgraced Whiteboyism, and was speedily pacified. Some years
later the greediness of Lord Donegal, who for the sake of gain
evicted over 6,000 protestant families and replaced them by new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
tenants, many of them catholics, caused a rising in Antrim and
Down. Already numerous presbyterians of Ulster, men of Scottish
and English descent, had been driven by the destruction of
the woollen trade and the disabilities imposed by the test act
to emigrate to America, and many of Donegal's evicted tenantry
followed their example. Ireland lost men who should have
defended British interests, and America gained some of her
best soldiers in the revolutionary war. The feud between the
protestants and catholics of Ulster arising out of Donegal's
evictions bore bitter fruit in later troubles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE IRISH PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_70" id="TOPIC_70"></a>The Irish house of commons was composed exclusively
of protestants, elected exclusively by protestants. Of its 300
members sixty-four were returned for counties and were in some
measure elected by the people. Two were returned for Trinity
College, Dublin. The remainder sat for cities and boroughs,
and of these 172 were nominated by borough-owners. The
duration of parliament was only terminated by the demise of
the crown. The house was the representative of the protestant
aristocracy and was completely out of touch with the mass of
the people. It had little control of finance, for the Irish establishments
were large. The civil list was burdened with
pensions and sinecures, distributed either as a means of parliamentary
corruption, or among the supporters of the castle policy
and the hangers-on of the English court. By Poyning's law
the Irish parliament was subordinated to the English privy
council, and could not be summoned until the bills which it was
called upon to pass had received the assent of the council. A
desire for greater independence was growing up in parliament,
and a patriotic party eagerly pressed for reforms, for the
extension of the <i>habeas corpus</i> act to Ireland, for securing the
judges in office, and for shorter parliaments. The government
was in the hands of a party called the "Irish interest" which
worked harmoniously with the English ministers. Its chiefs,
the "undertakers," undertook the king's business in parliament,
administered the country, and dispensed patronage, for the
lord-lieutenant only resided in Ireland during the session of
parliament, that is for six months every other year. They
answered roughly to the whig oligarchy in England at the beginning
of the reign, and in spite of some extravagance and
corruption used their power not altogether ill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_71" id="TOPIC_71"></a>George, who was sincerely anxious for the good government
of the country, desired, as a matter of general policy, to break
down the power of the undertakers, as he had broken down the
power of the whigs in England. He also had a special point to
carry; he wanted to obtain the consent of parliament to an
augmentation of the Irish army from 12,000 to 15,000 men. As
the peace establishment of Great Britain was only about 17,000
men, the crown certainly needed a larger force, but it was unfair
to lay the burden of providing it on Ireland. With these objects
the ministry sent the Marquis Townshend, Charles Townshend's
brother, to Ireland as viceroy in 1767, ordering him to
reside there throughout his term of office. After much difficulty
Townshend obtained the augmentation, with the proviso that
12,000 troops should be kept in the country, and the patriotic
party, Lord Charlemont, Lucas, Flood, and others, were gratified
by the octennial act limiting the duration of parliament to eight
years. When the new parliament met, the commons acting
under the influence of the undertakers, renewed an attempt
made at the beginning of the reign to establish their authority
over supply by rejecting a money bill which, according to custom,
had been prepared by the government and returned by the
English privy council. Townshend prorogued parliament; and
before its next meeting secured a majority by wholesale corruption,
such as had been employed in England by Fox and Bute,
and overthrew the power of the undertakers. His want of tact
and his indecorous conduct rendered his victory fruitless, and
he was recalled in 1772.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_72" id="TOPIC_72"></a>The general election of 1768 was even more corrupt than
that of 1761. Again both the court and the nabobs came well
to the front. Borough-mongers did a business in seats much
as house-agents did in houses. One of them laughed when Lord
Chesterfield offered &pound;2,500 for a seat for his son; the nabobs,
he said, had raised prices to at least &pound;3,000; some seats had
fetched &pound;4,000, two as much as &pound;5,000. George Selwyn took
&pound;9,000 for the two seats for Ludgershall. The city of Oxford
offered to return its two sitting members if they would pay the
city's debts, &pound;5,670. They informed the house of commons
of the offer, and ten of the leading citizens were confined for five
days in Newgate, and afterwards knelt at the bar of the house
and were reprimanded by the speaker&mdash;a solemn farce, for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
sold the seats to two neighbouring magnates, and are said
to have arranged the transaction while they were in prison.
Holland bought a seat for his second son, Charles James Fox,
then a youth of nineteen. As was natural in his father's son,
Fox supported the ministers, and was soon distinguished in
parliament by his opposition to all liberal measures, and outside
it by reckless gambling and extravagance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WILKES RETURNED FOR MIDDLESEX.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_73" id="TOPIC_73"></a>Wilkes, who made a short visit to England in 1766, when
he remained quiet and was not disturbed, was brought back
again by the election. He stood for the city of London, was at
the bottom of the poll, and announced that he would stand for
Middlesex. His proceedings caused much excitement, for the
country was discontented and disturbed. The price of bread
was high, and during the early part of the year there were
many strikes and much rioting, especially in London. The
Spitalfields weavers made several riots and broke the looms of
those who refused to join in their demands. The sailors
struck, and detained all outward-bound vessels in the Thames.
The coal-heavers also struck, and fought fierce battles with the
sailors in which many lives were lost. Though some of these
riots broke out a little later, they explain the excitement and
enthusiasm with which Wilkes was received by the London
mob. He was returned for Middlesex by a large majority.
The mob which had passed out from London to Brentford, the
polling-place, came back in triumph, forced people to illuminate
their houses, and smashed many windows. If on Wilkes's
return to England George had granted him a free pardon, the
demagogue would probably have subsided into a peaceable
member of parliament. Unfortunately he could not overlook
Wilkes's insults to himself and to his mother. Grafton came to
London as seldom as possible, but George found a willing instrument
in Weymouth. On April 17 Wilkes surrendered to
his outlawry. In anticipation of disturbances Weymouth wrote
to the Lambeth magistrates, bidding them, if need arose, to be
prompt in calling in the aid of the military.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_74" id="TOPIC_74"></a>On the 26th Wilkes was committed to the king's bench
prison. The populace drew him along in a coach to Spitalfields,
where he escaped their further attentions and voluntarily went
to the prison. An excited crowd daily assembled outside the
prison, and the riots of the sailors, coal-heavers, and sawyers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
grew formidable. Parliament was to meet on May 10, and
the king, believing that a serious riot would probably take
place on that day, recommended firmness and a prompt employment
of troops. The tone of his letters at this crisis is
unpleasant and shows personal animosity; yet neither he nor
Weymouth can justly be blamed for urging prompt and decided
measures, for they were necessary for the preservation of order
and for the protection of life and property. As George had
foreseen, a riot broke out on the 10th. A vast mob gathered
round the king's bench prison and in St. George's Fields, and
demanded that Wilkes should be liberated in order to take his
place in parliament. The riot act was read, the troops were
severely pelted, and some soldiers killed a young man named
Allen, whom they mistook for a ringleader of the rioters. The
order to fire was given; five of the mob were killed and several
wounded. Though for the moment the mob was mastered, this
untoward event exasperated the malcontents, and much indignation
was excited by an order signed by Barrington, which
assured the troops that they would be protected if "any disagreeable
circumstance" should arise in the execution of their
duty. On June 8 Lord Mansfield, the lord chief-justice, reversed
Wilkes's outlawry and sentenced him on the verdicts brought
against him in 1764 to fines of &pound;1,000, and twenty-two months
further imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_75" id="TOPIC_75"></a>While in prison Wilkes obtained Weymouth's letter of April
17, and published it with libellous comments, charging him with
having deliberately planned "the massacre" of St. George's
Fields. These comments were voted a seditious libel by the
commons. Wilkes's petition for redress of grievances was rejected;
he was brought to the bar of the house and avowed the
authorship of the comments on Weymouth's "bloody scroll," as
he called it. On the next day, February 3, 1769, Barrington
proposed his expulsion from the house, and supported his
motion by recapitulating his various misdeeds. Grenville, Burke,
and others urged that it was unfair to go back to past offences
and accumulate the charges against him, and Grenville warned
the house that the course on which it was embarking would
probably lead it into a violation of the rights of the electorate.
Nevertheless, the house lent itself to the wishes of the king
and voted the expulsion by 219 to 137. Grenville's warning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was justified. Wilkes was re-elected on the 16th, and the
next day the house annulled the election and declared him
incapable of being elected to serve in the present parliament.
That the house, whether acting justly or not, has a right to
expel any member whom it judges unworthy to sit, is indisputable,
but to declare an incapacity unknown to the law was an
unconstitutional and arbitrary proceeding. In spite of this
declaration Wilkes was again returned on March 16. The
election was again annulled. An address in support of the
king was prepared by the court party in the city, and on the
22nd hundreds set out in coaches for St. James's to deliver it.
They were pelted by a vast mob, and only a third of them
reached the palace. Meanwhile another mob gathered at St.
James's and tried to force a hearse bearing a picture of Allen's
death into the court-yard. They were foiled by the courage of
Talbot, the lord-steward, and were dispersed after some scuffling.
Throughout the whole day the king exhibited perfect composure,
though the riot was serious and might easily have become formidable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RIGHTS OF ELECTORS VIOLATED.</i></div>

<p>A new writ was issued for Middlesex, and Colonel Luttrell,
one of the court party, resigned his Cornish seat in order to
oppose Wilkes. In the previous December at the election of
Serjeant Glynn, Wilkes's counsel, to the other seat for the
county, one of his supporters lost his life. Two men were
found guilty of murdering him, and received a royal pardon,
for, though they assaulted him, the man's death was due to
natural causes. Luttrell was believed to be risking his life, and
bets were freely made as to his probable fate. The election,
however, passed off quietly on April 13, when Wilkes polled
1,143 votes and Luttrell 296. On the 15th, the house, after
a hot debate, carried by 197 to 143 a motion that Luttrell
"ought to have been returned". This decision, which set at
nought the rights of electors, was the inevitable outcome of the
vote of expulsion. The king was victorious, and was delighted
at his victory. His satisfaction was soon alloyed, for the means
which he had employed to gain his end roused widespread indignation.
He had brought himself into conflict with his people
and had blunted his weapons. He had gradually got together
a set of ministers through whom he could rule; for some of
them were his willing instruments, and the rest, though uneasy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
at their position, forbore to oppose him. At great cost to himself
and the nation he had secured a majority in the house of
commons, and he had strengthened his cause by enlisting on his
side the jealousy with which the house regarded all matters of
privilege. Neither his ministers nor the house failed him, not
even when called upon to violate the constitution, but his policy
rendered both alike odious to the nation. Wilkes was a gainer
by his own defeat. Thousands who had little or no sympathy
with him personally espoused his cause when they found it
justly associated with liberty. A large subscription was made
for him: &pound;17,000 was spent in paying his debts; his long-deferred
suit against Halifax was at last heard, and he obtained
&pound;4,000 damages; he was again enabled to live in comfort, and
while still in prison was elected an alderman of London.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_76" id="TOPIC_76"></a>Other causes contributed to the unpopularity of the ministers,
among them the French annexation of Corsica. The
island rebelled against the Genoese; and they, finding themselves
unable to subdue it, agreed to sell it to France. The bravery of
the insurgents excited sympathy in England; and there was a
strong feeling that the acquisition of the island by France would
increase her naval strength, which was reasonably regarded with
jealousy. "Corsica," said Burke, "as a province of France is
terrible to me;" and Sir Charles Saunders, who had commanded
in the Mediterranean, held that to prevent the proposed annexation
would be well worth a war. There was, however, something
to be said on the other side. The ministers might have pursued
either one of two courses. They might have given France to
understand that they would make the annexation of the island
a cause of war, and in that case France would probably have
drawn back; or they might, without loss of dignity, have passed
the matter by as no concern of theirs. Unfortunately, a decided
course was impossible to the divided cabinet. They remonstrated
vigorously, and France wavered. Then the Bedford
section made it known that England would not in any case
go to war, and France despised their remonstrance. Grafton
allowed the Corsicans to hope for British help, and secretly sent
them arms. This was worse than useless. The Corsican general,
Paoli, was forced to flee; the island was annexed to France in
1769, and, as Burke said, "British policy was brought into
derision".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ARREARS OF THE CIVIL LIST.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_77" id="TOPIC_77"></a>Again, in the midst of the struggle with the Middlesex
electorate, parliament was asked for &pound;513,500 to pay the debts
on the civil list. The civil list was sufficient to meet the legitimate
expenses of the crown; the king was personally frugal; how
had the deficiency arisen? Beyond all question the money had
been spent in augmenting the influence of the crown by multiplying
offices and pensions, by the purchase of votes at elections,
and other corrupt means. The ministers were responsible to the
nation for the way in which the public money had been spent.
The opposition, and specially Grenville, Burke, and Dowdeswell,
urged that before the house made the grant, it should inquire
into the causes which rendered it necessary. Their demand was
resisted: the house decided not to consider the causes of the
debts, and the ministers carried the grant without inquiry. By
this evil precedent the commons abandoned the constitutional
means of checking the expenditure of the public money by the
crown, and proved themselves unfaithful to their duty towards
the nation.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_78" id="TOPIC_78"></a>Violent attacks were made on the ministers by the press.
The most famous of these are the letters signed "Junius," and
others attributed, some of them with little probability, to the
same author, which appeared first in the <i>Public Advertizer</i>, a
London daily paper. Their fame is partly due to the mystery
of their authorship. For that doubtful honour more than thirty
names have been suggested. On strong, if not perfectly convincing
grounds, Junius is now generally believed to have been
Philip Francis, then a clerk in the war office and later a member
of the East India council and a knight, though, if he was the
author, he probably received help from some one of higher social
position, possibly from Temple.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> As literature the letters are
remarkable for clearness of expression and for a polish of style
so high as to be artificial and monotonous; their chief literary
defect is violence of language. Occupied almost exclusively
with personal vituperation, they deal with events as opportunities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for abuse rather than for thoughtful comment, with constitutional
doctrines as weapons of attack rather than as bulwarks of liberty.
The writer's political opinions are based on narrow grounds;
he exhibits no power of generalisation or philosophic thought.
Sheltered by his carefully guarded anonymity, he exercised
a vile ingenuity in devising how he might wound most deeply
persons whom he dared not attack in his own name. Without
regard to decency or truth he mocks with devilish glee at the
vices, failings, and misfortunes of the objects of his hatred.
His attacks on the chief ministers of the crown, on Grafton, Bedford,
North, Weymouth, and Sandwich, on Mansfield, and on the
king himself, excited intense curiosity. Before long their violence
defeated their purpose and the disgraceful "Letter to the King,"
published in December, 1769, excited general disgust.</p>

<p>The anger caused by the issue of the struggle with the Middlesex
electors found voice in petitions to the throne. Middlesex
sent up a manifesto, which was virtually adopted by London,
accusing the ministers of treason; Westminster prayed for a
dissolution of parliament, and some counties and boroughs
followed its example, arguing that the presence of Luttrell, who
had not been duly elected, invalidated every act of the existing
parliament. London further declared itself against the court
party by electing Beckford, a prime mover in promoting the
Surrey petition, as lord mayor. The country, however, was
not all on the same side; the petitions were not, as a rule,
signed by many of the larger freeholders, and by the end of
the year the movement seemed at a stand.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In July Chatham
appeared at court restored to health. The king received him
kindly, but must have been vexed to hear that he disapproved
of the policy of the ministers, specially with regard to the
Middlesex election. He treated Grafton with extreme coldness,
and Camden, who had sneered at him in his absence, at once
followed his lead. He allied himself with the opposition, with
Temple, Grenville, and their following, and with the Rockingham
party, so far as measures were concerned. With the
Rockinghams, however, he was never wholly at one; his violence,
and habit of looking beyond parliament to the people itself, and
of seeking political strength in popular good-will, separated him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from them in feeling and methods of action. Yet his alliance
with them was never formally broken. He entered into it because,
he said, former differences should be forgotten when the
struggle was <i>pro aris et focis</i>. He was eager for the fray.
Parliament, said he, "must, it shall, be dissolved". With him
as leader and with a united opposition, backed by a large part
of the nation, victory seemed almost certain. He reckoned
without the king. An ostensible minister might be forced to
resign; but the king was a permanent official, and George was
hard to beat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHATHAM IN OPPOSITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_79" id="TOPIC_79"></a>Parliament met on January 9, 1770. It was a critical time:
at home discontent was widespread; the American colonies
were disaffected; war with France and Spain seemed not far
off. The king's speech recommended attention to American
affairs and hinted at the unfriendly attitude of foreign courts,
but took no notice of domestic discontents, and gave prominence
to an outbreak of distemper among "horned cattle". The
cattle plague was a matter of serious national concern; yet the
speech was insufficient for the occasion; it was, Junius declared,
the speech of "a ruined grazier". It showed that the ministers
intended to ignore the signs of popular indignation. Chatham
moved, as an amendment to the address, that the lords would
inquire into the causes of the prevailing discontents and specially
into the matter of the Middlesex election. "The people," he
said, "demand redress, and depend upon it, my lords, that one
way or other they will have redress;" and he attributed their
discontent to the action of the commons in Wilkes's case.
Camden followed, and declared that he had beheld the arbitrary
acts of the ministry with silent indignation, that he would no
longer keep silence, and was of the same opinion as Chatham.
Mansfield opposed the amendment on the ground that it infringed
upon the right of the commons to be sole judges of
elections and might lead to a quarrel between the two houses.
Chatham said that he reverenced the constitutional authority
of the commons, but they had gone beyond it, they had
betrayed their constituents and violated the constitution. He
ended with a declamation exhorting the peers to act as became
descendants of the barons of Magna Charta (how many of them
could trace descent from so noble a source?) and like "those
iron barons, for so," said he, "I may call them when compared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
with the silken barons of modern days," to defend the rights
of the people at large. His amendment was negatived. The
address was carried in the lords by 203 to 36, and in the
commons after a hot debate by 254 to 138.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_80" id="TOPIC_80"></a>Camden's conduct was discreditable. It is true that the
maxim that a member of the cabinet should either acquiesce in
the decision of the majority or resign his seat in it, was not then
universally accepted, and that Camden had made it plain that
he disapproved of the policy of his colleagues with respect to
the vote of incapacity. He had not, however, opposed it with
any show of determination. His alliance with Chatham made
it certain that he could not retain the chancellorship, yet he
would not resign it, because he could inflict a harder blow on the
ministry as a member of it than he could when out of office.
Decency demanded that he should resign before he appealed to
the lords against a decision made by the cabinet in which he
sat. He was dismissed from office on the 17th. Granby at
once threw up the ordnance and the command of the army, and
Dunning, the solicitor-general, and some others also resigned.
It was difficult to find a new chancellor, for the ministry was
believed to be moribund. Grafton offered the great seal to
Charles Yorke, the second son of the famous chancellor, Hardwicke,
who died in 1764. He had twice been attorney-general,
and was an ambitious man. His brother, Lord Hardwicke, and
Rockingham, to whose party he had attached himself, urged
him not to accept the offer, and he declined it. On the 17th,
George told him that if he did not accept the great seal then,
it should never be offered to him again. He yielded, and his
brother and Rockingham reproached him bitterly for his compliance.
He was in ill-health and his malady may well have
been increased by his agitation. In any case, he died on the
20th, perhaps by his own hand. His death defeated Grafton's
one hope of strengthening the administration; he had no one in
the cabinet on whose support he could rely except Conway; for
Weymouth and the rest constantly acted contrary to his opinions.
He resigned office on the 28th.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S POLICY SUCCESSFUL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_81" id="TOPIC_81"></a>George was undaunted; he turned to the one man of eminence
among his remaining ministers and appointed North to
the treasury, to be held along with the chancellorship of the
exchequer. Few changes were made in the ministry; the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
seal was put in commission, and Mansfield, who remained in the
cabinet, took the speakership of the house of lords. Conway
retired from the cabinet. Thurlow, a strong advocate of prerogative,
coarse, blunt, yet insincere, became solicitor-general,
and the other vacant places were filled. Yet these changes mark
an important epoch. During Grafton's administration the king
became master of the government, but was forced to employ unsatisfactory
instruments for the exercise of his power. Though
differences of opinion still arose in the cabinet, the ministry
gained in solidarity and strength by the loss of its dissentient
members. Above all, George at last found a first minister
after his own heart. North had ability, tact, knowledge, and
an unfailing good temper; he was well educated and of high
moral character. Though ungainly in appearance and with no
oratorical talent, he was witty and formidable in debate. In
intellect he was the king's superior, but he allowed George's prejudices
to override his convictions. He would never be called
prime minister. George was his own prime minister, and he
merely his manager and representative. His submission to
the king at the cost of his duty to the country did not proceed
from selfish motives; it was the result partly of personal
attachment and partly of the action of the stronger upon the
weaker will. George repaid his devotion by giving him his full
confidence and constant support. North was lazy, yet this defect
added strength to the combination of king and minister.
Behind the scenes George was active and anxious, while in
parliament the weapons of indignation and sarcasm with which
North was assailed failed to pierce the impenetrable wall of his
amiable insouciance. The king's policy was triumphant. The
combination between the obedient responsible minister and the
imperious irresponsible king lasted for twelve years, during which
George ruled as well as reigned.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_82" id="TOPIC_82"></a>Again, the point we have reached marks an epoch, because
the rise of modern radicalism has with fair reason been traced to
the struggle over the Middlesex election in 1769, though in
accepting this judgment we must not forget that the radicalism
of 1819 was affected by events of later dates. In 1769, however,
as in 1819, the representatives of the people were opposed
to the will of the people. Where was sovereignty to reside?
In the nation as represented in parliament, or in the nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
external to it? When this question arises it can only be set at
rest by making parliament truly representative of the nation.
Accordingly popular discontent in 1769 was not merely directed
against ministers and measures, it demanded radical changes in
the constitutional machinery, and its demands were expressed
by means which, though not unconstitutional, were not recognised
by the constitution, such as public meetings and associations.
Meetings to express discontent and urge reforms were
constantly held, and an association for promoting the popular
demands, called the Bill of Rights Society, was formed by a
clerical demagogue named Horne (afterwards Horne Tooke),
Wilkes, Glynn, and others. Among the changes which they
demanded as remedies for the unsatisfactory state of the representation
were annual parliaments, the exaction of an oath
against bribery, and the exclusion from parliament of holders
of places and pensions. At this time, too, constituencies began
to assert a right to control their representatives by sending them
instructions as to their conduct in parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHATHAM AND BURKE AS REFORMERS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_83" id="TOPIC_83"></a>The movement found support in parliament. A few of the
minority were among its leaders; and others, though not disposed
to go so far, maintained the necessity for constitutional
reforms. Whig tactics were changed since the beginning of
the reign. Beaten by the king and his friends at the game of
corruption, the whigs had become the advocates of purity of
election. The fact need not reflect on personal characters.
Some of the whigs of 1769 were consistent in their opposition
to corruption. As regards others, it must be remembered that
abuses seldom shock a man who gains by them; they become
intolerable if they are turned against him. Chatham himself
once sat for Old Sarum, was elected for Seaford apparently
through bribery, and as minister was content that Newcastle
should gain him support by corruption. Chief among the abuses
which prevented the house of commons from representing the
people were the defects in its constitution. While the elections in
counties and some large boroughs were comparatively pure, the
representation of the smaller boroughs was a matter of nomination
or corruption. Out of the 513 members for England and
Wales, 254 sat for constituencies which, taken together, numbered
only 11,500 voters, and fifty-six boroughs had each less than
forty voters. Forty-four members sat for Cornish seats; Middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>sex,
London and Westminster together only returned eight.
Chatham at one time seemed to think that the corrupt boroughs
might be got rid of, but finally feared that such a change would
cause a "public convulsion," and proposed to counteract their
effects by adding one member to each of the county constituencies.
After much hesitation he also advocated a return to
triennial parliaments.</p>

<p>Burke, on the other hand, and the Rockingham party generally
were opposed to any change in the constitutional machinery.
The constitution was altogether admirable in Burke's eyes; all
that was wanted was the removal of abuses, which hindered it
from working well. Shorter parliaments would, he argued, only
lead to more frequent disorders and increase the opportunities
for corruption; he would have no change in the system of
representation, and held that a place bill would lower the character
of parliament by excluding from it many men of wealth,
weight, and talent. He strongly objected to the growing custom
of sending instructions to members, pointing out that members
of parliament should not be regarded as mere local delegates,
but as representatives of the nation, chosen by various constituent
bodies. While he was opposed to changes in the constitution,
he laboured to bring parliament into a sound state by
reforms which allowed the publication of its proceedings, improved
the system of deciding the lawfulness of elections, and
checked the multiplication of places and pensions, as well as by
other measures of a like tendency. The opposition then differed
amongst themselves: Chatham and his followers held that some
organic changes in the constitution were necessary, and more
or less sympathised with what (though the name was not yet
invented) may be called the radical party; Burke and those
under his influence railed at the bill of rights men, deprecated
organic changes, and advocated conservative reforms.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>THE KING'S RULE.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_84" id="TOPIC_84"></a>It was generally thought that North's administration would be
short-lived. The opposition was strong and apparently united,
and it had a large part of the people at its back. The public
expectation was ill-grounded. The king's influence in parliament
was not to be overborne; as many as 192 members of the
house of commons held office under government.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> North was
a first-rate leader and the king was industrious and determined.
Yet the strength of the ministry was largely derived from the
conduct of their opponents. The violence of the extreme section
of the popular party led to a revulsion of feeling in the
country. In parliament Chatham was not effective, for his
declamatory speeches and dictatorial manner were out of place
in the lords; and in the commons Burke was apt to weary the
house, and lost ground through constant breaches of good taste.
Above all, the two parties in the opposition, the extreme section,
with which Chatham had much sympathy, and the Rockingham
whigs, did not work well together. In the spring of 1770
Burke published his <i>Thoughts on the Causes of the Present
Discontents</i>, a masterly exposition of the existing political
abuses and of the remedies appropriate to them. Its rejection
of proposals for organic changes in the constitution annoyed
Chatham, who declared that it had done much harm to the
cause. He was soon irritated with the whigs generally. "Moderation,
moderation," said he, "is the burthen of their song;" he
would be "a scarecrow of violence to the gentle warblers of the
grove, the moderate whigs and temperate statesmen". He tried
to force the whigs to follow his lead, but Rockingham had no
mind to court Chatham's loud-voiced supporters in the city, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to adopt violent measures in order to assure the people that he
was true to their cause. Chatham thought it possible that it
might be expedient to separate himself from "so unorthodox a
congregation" as the whig party, and accused Burke and the
Rockinghams of a spirit of connexion. So bitter were his
feelings, that he and his friends rejoiced when Dowdeswell and
Burke, "those positive gentlemen," were defeated in an attempt
to vindicate the rights of juries, because they adopted a method
of procedure of which he did not approve; they were, his friend
Calcraft wrote to him, "completely disgraced," and Chatham
styled their bill "a compound of connexion, tyranny and
absurdity".<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> While the opposition was in this distracted state
the ministerial party was united. In three years' time at most
opposition in parliament was practically dead, and the ministry
was thoroughly popular in the country.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A DIVIDED OPPOSITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_85" id="TOPIC_85"></a>During the remainder of the session of 1769-70 the opposition
made a good fight. In the lords Chatham and Rockingham
co-operated in attempts to persuade the house to condemn the
action of the commons with reference to the Middlesex election,
and in debates on American affairs; but Rockingham refused to
join in moving an address to the king to dissolve parliament.
Chatham's motion was avowedly made in order to stimulate
popularity out of doors, and Rockingham, who disliked his
demagogic arts, thought it uncalled for and refused "to be
sworn every day to keep his word" to the people. Chatham
persevered, and the motion received little support. In the commons
George Grenville, Dowdeswell, who as Grenville's health
declined became virtually leader of the opposition, Burke,
Barr&eacute;, Wedderburn, an able and ambitious Scottish lawyer, and
others, aided by the extreme section of which Beckford and
Alderman Sawbridge were conspicuous members, caused the
ministry much trouble. North was the chief speaker on the
ministerial side. The court party, or king's friends, so far as
they may in any degree be regarded as distinct from the rest of
his supporters, seem to have been headed by Rigby, who since
1768 had lived in luxury on the vast profits of the paymaster's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
office. Dowdeswell's motion that in matters of election the
house is bound to judge according to the law of the land was so
threatening an attack that North met it by tacking to it an
amendment to the effect that the declaration of Wilkes's incapacity
was agreeable to that law, and the minority reached
180 against 244. The king, anxiously watching all that passed
in parliament, felt that even this majority was satisfactory.
"A little spirit," he wrote to North, "will soon restore order in
my service."</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_86" id="TOPIC_86"></a>The opposition were encouraged, and proceeded to attack
two of the sources from which the crown derived its influence.
As the expenses of the customs, amounting to nearly &pound;600,000
a year, gave ministers a large amount of patronage which was
used for political purposes, Dowdeswell proposed to disqualify
the inferior revenue officers from voting at elections. Again,
Grenville urged that parliament had paid the debts of the civil
list without receiving any assurance that further demands of the
same kind would not be made upon the country, and moved for
the accounts of the past year as the only means of preventing
the revenues of the crown from being spent on corruption. On
both these motions the ministerial majority was substantially
larger than on the Middlesex question. Nevertheless, the opposition
succeeded in carrying one measure which removed an abuse
of the representative system and raised the character of the
house of commons. The custom, which had lately become
usual, of trying the validity of controverted elections by the
whole house, and determining it by vote, placed the rights of
electors in the hands of the minister who commanded a majority.
During the hearing of an election petition the house would be
thin, for the evidence was of little consequence; the decision
was a trial of strength between political parties, each side would
muster its full force, and a seat would be secured or taken away
merely in order to swell a triumphant majority. Grenville
proposed to transfer the right of hearing and determining these
cases from the whole house to a committee of fifteen members,
thirteen of whom were to be chosen by ballot, and the other
two nominated by the two candidates. The fifteen were to be
sworn to decide impartially, and to have power to examine
witnesses on oath. An effort to postpone the bill, though
supported by North, was defeated by 185 to 123, the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
gentlemen on this occasion voting with the opposition; the bill
was carried, passed the lords, and became law on April 12.
The measure reflects lustre on the memory of Grenville, who
devised it and carried it through when suffering from mortal
sickness. The act, which was limited in committee to seven
years, was found so useful that it was made perpetual in 1774.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE "BOSTON MASSACRE".</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_87" id="TOPIC_87"></a>The decision to abandon all the new duties levied in
America, except that on tea, was brought before the house of
commons by North on March 6, 1770. The idea of making
the Americans pay for their own defence was dropped, and the
tax, which brought in only a trifling sum, was to be maintained as
an assertion of right. Grenville pointed out that a partial repeal
would not conciliate the colonists, that the troubles in America
had been caused by vacillation, and that what was wanted was
a plan of government steadily pursued and enforced. The
opposition desired complete repeal, and the ministerial majority
was only 62. On the evening before this debate an event took
place at Boston which strengthened the spirit of resistance.
The cowardly insults to which the soldiers were exposed after
the reduction of their number led to various scuffles; but their
discipline prevented them from effectually retaliating on their
persecutors, and baiting the soldiers became a popular pastime.
On the evening of the 5th Captain Preston of the 29th regiment
and about a dozen soldiers went to the rescue of a sentinel who
was being ill-treated by the mob. After some provocation his
men fired without orders, three of the mob were killed on the
spot, two others were mortally and several more slightly
wounded. The next day the townspeople, led by Samuel
Adams, insisted on the removal of the troops. Hutchinson
yielded to their demand, and both regiments were withdrawn
to Castle William. Preston and his men were brought to trial,
and were treated with remarkable fairness. All were acquitted
except two soldiers, who were slightly punished. The decision
of parliament with reference to the new duties reached the
colonies when the temper of the people was excited by this
untoward event, the "Boston massacre" as it was called, and
was regarded rather as a partial acknowledgment of defeat than
as an attempt at conciliation. Disputes, however, arose over
the non-importation agreements. Self-interest proved stronger
than political feeling: the agreements were constantly broken;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
indeed, the imports to New England and Pennsylvania increased
to one-half more than their usual amount. In October the
agreements were everywhere definitely abandoned, and new
agreements were made against the importation of tea only.
With that exception, commerce with England again revived.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_88" id="TOPIC_88"></a>Outside parliament a strong party in the city, led by Beckford
and supported by Chatham, was clamorous against the
government. In spite of the disapproval of nearly all the
aldermen, Beckford held a meeting of the livery to complain
that the petition of the city with reference to the Middlesex
election had not been answered. The meeting adopted an
arrogantly worded remonstrance to the king, declaring that "a
secret and malign influence" deprived the people of their
dearest rights, and desiring the dissolution of parliament and
the removal of evil ministers. In accordance with a prescriptive
right, this remonstrance was received by the king in person on
March 14. George replied to it with a severe rebuke; the
remonstrance was, he said, disrespectful to himself, injurious
to his parliament, and irreconcilable with the principles of
the constitution. The court party was much excited, and at
the Cocoa-tree Tavern, the meeting-place or club of the supporters
of the ministry, talked loudly of impeachments. North
wisely held them back.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The house of commons could not
allow the insult to itself to pass unnoticed, and a copy of the
remonstrance was moved for. Beckford and his friends in the
house defended it, and Burke passionately urged the folly and
injustice of quarrelling with the city for exercising the right of
petition and remonstrance. North calmed down the heat of the
debate, and pointed out the unconstitutional character of the
remonstrance, which virtually denied the authority of the existing
parliament. The motion was carried, and further debates
took place. The whigs, though firm in asserting the right of
petition, disliked the tone that had been adopted by the city,
and an address to the king condemning the remonstrance was
carried by 248 to 94. Chatham was furious. With his warm
approval a remonstrance to the king was sent from Westminster,
and Middlesex and Kent followed suit; but Rockingham's refusal
to support his motion in favour of a dissolution plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
showed him that he could not force the whigs to adopt violent
measures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING AND THE CITY OF LONDON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_89" id="TOPIC_89"></a>The city would not endure the king's rebuke in silence,
and another remonstrance was adopted to the same effect
as the former, though it addressed the king in more dutiful
language. George received it on May 23, and replied that
his sentiments on the subject of the first address were unchanged.
As soon as he ceased speaking, Beckford made a
harangue to which the king returned no answer. The words
attributed to Beckford, and afterwards inscribed in gilt letters in
the Guildhall, were that whoever alienated the king's mind from
his people in general and the city of London in particular was
his majesty's enemy and "a betrayer of our happy constitution
as it was established at the glorious and necessary revolution".
Brave words which, as there is reason to believe, were invented
for him and never spoken.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Beckford's friends believed that he
had got the better of the king, and Chatham in a grandiose letter
to him declared that "the spirit of old England spoke that never-to-be-forgotten
day". Nevertheless, Beckford's conduct was
highly indecorous. The sovereign never performs a public act
on his own responsibility, and accordingly all addresses on public
affairs which are to be answered in person are sent beforehand
to the proper officer that the king may receive the advice of his
ministers as to his reply. Beckford tried to entrap the king into
entering into a personal altercation and replying without consultation
with his constitutional advisers. George, who in public
never fell short of his kingly part, defeated his purpose by silence
and afterwards ordered that his unexpected speech was not to
be looked upon as precedent.</p>

<p>He prorogued parliament a few days before this incident.
For some months his mind had been tried severely. His
power, which he loved so well and conscientiously believed himself
bound to maintain, was at stake in the political conflict.
His letters to North prove how eagerly and anxiously he watched
the progress of that conflict in which he was really, though not
ostensibly, engaged in person. If Chatham and the city had
succeeded in forcing him to dissolve parliament on the ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
that its authority was vitiated by the nomination of Luttrell as
a member for Middlesex, he would have suffered a defeat which
even his dogged perseverance would have failed to retrieve.
Rather than that, "I will," he said to Conway, "have recourse
to this," and he laid his hand on his sword. The opposition had
a good cause, but, as we have seen, they played their part badly.
Among the reasons of their failure a conspicuous place must be
assigned to the displeasure excited by the attacks made on the
king by the more violent section, the vile letter of Junius, the
rudeness of the city, and the like. The constant references
which were made to some secret influence, presumably that of
his mother or Bute, which was supposed to guide him were as
foolish as they were rude, for George's policy was his own. His
anxieties and troubles were almost more than he could bear.
"At the [royal] gardening (<i>sic</i>) party" on June 2 he burst into
tears and talked somewhat strangely; he had, it was believed,
"for some time been much agitated and lived (as usual when
he is so) on vegetables and fruit".<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The symptoms happily
passed away. He had, indeed, cause for cheerfulness, for the
ministry was in a far stronger position at the end of the session
than when North took office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SPAIN AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_90" id="TOPIC_90"></a>The next session began early, on November 13, for a war
with Spain seemed imminent. Choiseul was anxious to make
the Family Compact the means of humbling England and of regaining
for France the territories she had lost. He patiently
built up a new navy, until France had afloat sixty-four ships of
the line and fifty frigates; and he organised the naval artillery.
Grimaldi, the foreign minister of Spain, shared his hopes and
followed his example; the Spanish navy was increased, and the
dockyards well stocked, though as usual the seamen were few.
For some time both powers showed an inclination to treat
England with contempt; they believed her to be enfeebled
by domestic discord, and her conduct with reference to the
Manila ransom, the annexation of Corsica, and some other
matters, strengthened this opinion. In 1770 the ministers of
the two Bourbon courts went a step too far. The Falkland
islands, to the east of the straits of Magellan, though in reality
only fit for sheep-farming, were generally believed to be fertile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Acting on this belief, France took possession of the eastern
island in 1764, and shortly afterwards handed it over to Spain.
Meanwhile, in 1765, England took possession of the western
island and formed a settlement on it, which was named Port
Egmont, after the first lord of the admiralty. In November,
1769, Captain Hunt of the <i>Tamar</i>, sloop of war, observed a
Spanish schooner hovering off this settlement and warned her to
depart. The Spanish captain asserted that the island belonged
to his master, and two Spanish frigates arrived soon afterwards
and repeated the claim. Hunt gave them a decided answer,
and as it was agreed that both parties should refer the claim of
right to their governments, sailed for England leaving a small
garrison in Port Egmont. During his absence Buccarelli, the
governor of Buenos Ayres, took forcible possession of the island,
and, in order to ensure being the first to send the news to Spain,
had the impudence to remove the rudder of a British ship of
war, and detained her for twenty days.</p>

<p>Harris, afterwards first Earl of Malmesbury, the British
<i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> at Madrid, at once made a suitable remonstrance,
but, as Grimaldi expected support from France, received
no satisfaction. The British government, which had not bestirred
itself on receiving Hunt's report in June, at once prepared
for war, and the king's speech declared that proper reparation
would be required. The navy in that year numbered 337 ships,
only forty-two less than in 1763, of which three were first-rates,
fifteen second-rates, and 100 third-rates, besides forty-four sloops.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Some of these, however, were thoroughly rotten, and many
more in bad repair, and the dockyards were short of seasoned
timber. For some years the navy had been neglected, and,
though the votes for the service had been large, much money
had been eaten up by abuses. Hawke, however, had done something
in breaking-up worn-out vessels, repairing, and building.
Forty ships of the line besides frigates were soon nearly ready
for sea. There was some difficulty in manning them, for the
peace establishment was only 16,000 men. North said that 9,000
additional seamen were wanted at once, and raised the land tax to
four shillings. Bounties were offered and press-gangs were busy.
The new lord mayor, Trecothick, one of the violent party in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
city, refused to sign the press-warrants. Chatham praised his
"firmness," but disapproved his action, for impressment was,
he said, constitutional and in times of emergency necessary.
Grimaldi looked to France in vain. Louis, who was then under
the influence of Madame du Barri, was determined not to go
to war; "my minister," he wrote to Charles of Spain, "would
have war, but I will not". Choiseul was dismissed in disgrace,
and was succeeded by the Duc d'Aiguillon. Spain had no
choice but to yield to the demands of Great Britain, and on
January 22, 1771, disowned Buccarelli's action, and agreed to
deliver up Port Egmont as it was before it was seized. Throughout
the whole progress of the affair the opposition attacked the
government, alleging that it was careless of the honour of
England, had exhibited a lack of promptitude, and had made
a secret agreement with Spain to abandon the island; they
even insinuated that the minister had truckled to France in
order to prevent her from taking part with Spain. Their
attacks were factious. The government had no desire to rush
needlessly into war, but it acted with vigour and decision, and
carried the matter through with a sufficiently high hand. The
islands were soon afterwards deserted as unprofitable, but the
British right to them was not abandoned.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_91" id="TOPIC_91"></a>The dispute with Spain caused a temporary increase in the
manning of the navy, and in 1771 the number mustered was
25,836. Though the condition of the navy was unsatisfactory,
the sea-power of Great Britain was an important factor in
European politics. With regard to them the guiding principle
of England was the maintenance of a good understanding with
Russia. Commercially this was of first-rate importance, while
politically it counterbalanced the alliance of the Bourbon courts.
During the war between Catherine of Russia and the Turks which
began in 1769, Russia owed much to the good-will of England;
a Russian fleet was allowed to refit at Spithead and soldiers to
land for refreshment, an English admiral and other officers were
employed by the empress, and one of her ships of war was
docked and altered at Portsmouth. A Russian fleet for the
first time appeared in the Levant and inflicted a severe defeat
on the Turks. France was anxious to interfere on the side of
the Turks, but was held back by the declaration that the appearance
of French ships in the Archipelago would bring British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
ships thither also. A revolution effected in Sweden by Gustavus
III. in 1772 opened the way for the increase of French influence
in that kingdom. This displeased Russia, and D'Aiguillon
made naval preparations for the defence of Sweden against any
attack from Russia and Denmark. Lord Stormont, the nephew
and afterwards successor of the Earl of Mansfield, who was then
ambassador at Paris, insisted that if a French fleet sailed for the
Baltic, so too would a British fleet. The government was ready
to support his words. In view of the increasing signs of the
desire of France to push her interests in Europe, North in
December, 1772, obtained a vote for 20,000 men for the navy.
In the end France discontinued her preparations. Her attitude
was closely connected with the arrangement by which, in 1772,
Austria, Russia, and Prussia divided a large part of Poland
between themselves. This act of spoliation, the first partition
of Poland, drew forth no remonstrance from England; in itself
it did not concern us, and its effect on the balance of power in
Europe was regarded with complacency as lowering to France
and as an aggrandisement of powers which would act as a
counterpoise to the Bourbon alliance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MINISTERIAL CHANGES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_92" id="TOPIC_92"></a>During the winter of 1770-71 some changes took place in
the ministry. Weymouth, finding himself unequal to meet the
Spanish crisis, resigned the seals, and Rochford took the southern
and Halifax the northern department. Hawke was succeeded
at the admiralty by Sandwich, who worked hard, though he
appears to have applied his industry and abilities too largely
to personal arrangements. Bathurst, an insignificant person, became
lord chancellor, Thurlow attorney-general, and Wedderburn,
hitherto a bitter opponent of the ministry, solicitor-general; he
ratted disgracefully, and was perhaps insincere from the first.
Determined to attain the chancellorship, he may have intended
to force North to give him office, by showing himself dangerous
in opposition. George Grenville died in November, 1770, and
several of his friends, headed by the Earl of Suffolk, a man of
small ability, went over to the ministerial side. Suffolk was made
privy seal and, on the death of Halifax in the following June,
became secretary of state. He was succeeded as privy seal by
Grafton, who, in accepting the office, showed his lack of confidence
in his colleagues by stipulating that he should not be summoned
to cabinet meetings. Besides the serious blow which the oppo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>sition
at large sustained in the death of Grenville, Beckford's
death, soon after his egregious performance at St. James's, deprived
Chatham of an eager follower and the city party of its
leader. Later in the year, too, died Granby, who a few months
before repented of the support he had given to the ministry and
had joined the opposition.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_93" id="TOPIC_93"></a>The violent language employed by the newspapers on the
opposition side laid them open to reprisals. Constant resort to
indictments by the attorney-general, and the exception of seditious
libels from privilege of parliament, indicate the desire of the king's
party to treat press offences in a special way. They were gratified
by a ruling of Chief-justice Mansfield in the case of Almon,
a bookseller, who was tried on an <i>ex officio</i> indictment for
selling Junius's <i>Letter to the King</i>. Mansfield laid down that
in cases of libel the jury could only deal with the facts of printing
and publishing; it belonged to the judge to decide the character
of the statement. This was not a new doctrine; it had been
declared and acted upon by many earlier judges. The newspaper
press, however, had by this time become important, and
Mansfield's ruling infringed on the liberties of those engaged
upon it, for, while that was the law, a man after being indicted
by the attorney-general, who held office by, and at the pleasure
of the crown, was deprived of his right to be judged by his
peers on the substantial point at issue. Indignant juries refused
to convict in libel cases, and Mansfield's ruling was attacked by
the opposition in parliament. Chatham and Camden denied its
legality. In the commons, though a proposal to abolish <i>ex officio</i>
informations received little support, a motion for a committee of
inquiry into the rights of juries was only defeated by 184 to 176.
Dowdeswell and Burke believed that the question of law was
likely to hinder a satisfactory settlement, and in March, 1771,
Dowdeswell moved for an act to give juries the powers denied
to them. A section of the opposition, however, held with
Chatham and Camden that the matter should be settled by a
bill declaring that the law gave them these powers. They
would not support the motion, which was lost by an overwhelming
majority; and Mansfield's ruling was received as law
until 1792.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE PRINTERS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_94" id="TOPIC_94"></a>Another matter connected with the press engaged the house
of commons for the most part of the remainder of the session<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of 1771. Parliament, as we have seen, was so constituted that
occasions might and did arise on which the will of the people
was not fairly represented. This constitutional difficulty was
increased by the secrecy in which parliament shrouded its proceedings.
Once useful as a means of securing freedom of debate,
this secrecy was maintained as a matter of privilege after it had
become useless and, indeed, pernicious. It was carried to an
extreme point by the present parliament, the "unreported parliament"
as it was called. Strangers were constantly made to
withdraw from both houses, specially when a popular member
of the opposition rose to speak. This caused a silly quarrel
between the two houses in 1770, and either shut its doors against
the members of the other. The publication of reports, forbidden
by a standing order of 1762, had for some time been carried on
under various disguises, and the reports, which were founded
on scanty information, were often unfair and scurrilous. In
February, 1771, Colonel Onslow complained of two newspapers
which misrepresented his conduct in the house, and held him
up to contempt by describing him as "little cocking George".
Disregarding a warning from Burke as to the folly of entering
into a quarrel with the press and attempting to keep its proceedings
from the public, the house ordered the printers, Wheble
and Thompson, to attend at the bar. The serjeant-at-arms
failed to find them, and was jeered at by their workmen. A
proclamation was then issued for their arrest. While this affair
was pending several newspapers commented on the proceedings
of the house, and attacked various members, and specially
Onslow, describing him as "a paltry insignificant insect" and
so on. On March 12 he moved to proceed against six other
printers. The opposition, led by Dowdeswell, Burke, and Barr&eacute;,
made a determined stand. They divided the house twenty-three
times, and it sat till 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> "Posterity," said Burke, "will bless
the pertinaciousness of that day." Onslow's motion was carried;
some of the printers were reprimanded, one, Miller, refused to
attend.</p>

<p>The city reformers seized the opportunity of renewing their
quarrel with the house. Wheble and Thompson were collusively
arrested and were discharged, Wheble by alderman Wilkes and
Thompson by alderman Oliver, as not being accused of any
crime. Worse was to come. Miller was arrested by a messenger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of the house, and gave the messenger in charge for assaulting
him. Both were brought before Brass Crosby, the lord mayor,
Wilkes, and Oliver; Miller was discharged, the messenger held
to bail. The house ordered Crosby and Oliver, who were both
members of it, to attend in their places, and Wilkes, who was at
the bottom of the affair, at the bar. Wilkes refused to attend
unless as member for Middlesex, and the house, with more discretion
than valour, shrank from another conflict with him. The
king, who was deeply interested in the quarrel, approved; he
would, he said, "have nothing more to do with that devil Wilkes".
Crosby and Oliver defended their conduct, and were committed
to the Tower. During the proceedings an angry crowd interrupted
the business of the house, pelted several members, roughly
handled North and Charles Fox, who was conspicuous as a
defender of privilege, and broke their carriages. The lord
mayor and Oliver were visited in the Tower by Rockingham,
Burke, and other members of the opposition. On their release,
at the end of the session, on May 8, they were saluted by the
cannon of the artillery company and by vociferous applause,
and the city was illuminated. Proceedings against the messenger
were stopped by the attorney-general. Though the house was
victorious, its dignity suffered so greatly in the conflict that it
forbore to follow up its victory. Burke's words proved true; for
though the publication of debates was still held to be a breach
of privilege, no further attempt was made to punish it. Soon
after this dispute with the house of commons the city reformers
quarrelled amongst themselves, and the party was split up.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROYAL MARRIAGE ACT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_95" id="TOPIC_95"></a>Though political disputes dulled the interest excited by theological
questions in the earlier half of the century, the house
of commons was invited on February 6, 1772, to abolish the
subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles which was demanded
of all clergymen and of all students matriculating at Oxford
and Cambridge. The movement was connected with a tendency
towards unitarianism, which, besides attracting many dissenters,
exercised an influence within the Church. Some churchmen
seceded; others, less decided, sought to be relieved of an unwelcome
obligation. An association which met at the Feathers
Tavern, in the Strand, sent a petition to the house signed by
about two hundred and fifty men, clergy, doctors, and lawyers,
praying to be relieved of subscription. The king was hostile to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the petition, and North opposed it in moderate terms. Burke
spoke against it with remarkable ability, pointing out that a
standard of faith was necessary to insure order in the Church,
and that subscription to the Bible would not, as the petitioners
maintained, afford any criterion of belief. The petition was
rejected by a large majority, though several members on both
sides expressed a dislike to requiring subscription at the universities
from youths who were not of an age to judge of such
matters. The house, though it refused to allow clergymen to
evade the formularies of their Church, was not averse from toleration.
A bill to relieve dissenting ministers and teachers from
subscription to certain of the articles, which was indeed rarely
exacted, was carried in the commons with little opposition, but
the king and the bishops were strongly opposed to it; the royal
influence was used against it in the house of lords, which threw
out the bill both in 1772 and 1773, and it did not become law
until six years later.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_96" id="TOPIC_96"></a>The opposition was moribund. An annual motion was made
for shortening the duration of parliaments; but it attracted little
attention, and other questions which had lately agitated men's
minds fell equally out of date. A momentary revival of political
excitement was caused by a bill which affected the king personally.
George had family troubles. His sister Caroline, Queen
of Denmark, was accused of adultery and imprisoned; she was
allowed to retire to Hanover, and remained there until her death.
Soon after hearing of her daughter's disgrace the king's mother
died of cancer. She had long ceased to have any political
influence and was eminently charitable, yet the sufferings of
her last days were exulted over by scribblers opposed to the
court, and her funeral was hailed with the cheers of the city
mob. About the same time one of George's brothers, the Duke
of Cumberland, after disgracing him by his flagrant immorality,
married Mrs. Horton, the widowed daughter of Lord Irnham,
and sister of Luttrell, the Middlesex member; and the private
marriage of another brother, the Duke of Gloucester, to the
widow of Lord Waldegrave, a bastard daughter of Horace
Walpole's brother, was publicly announced. George was deeply
annoyed by these marriages and forbade the offenders to appear
at court. At his wish the royal marriage bill was laid before
parliament. By this act no descendant of George II. under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
age of twenty-six can enter into a valid marriage without the
sovereign's consent; nor above that age, should the sovereign's
consent be withheld, except by giving a year's notice to the
privy council, so that parliament may, if it chooses, forbid the
marriage. The doctrine implied in this act, that the whole royal
family forms a class apart from the rest of the nation, was foreign
to English ideas and smacked rather of German than English
royalty. Yet, whatever the effects of the act may have been on
those most nearly concerned, they have been beneficial to the
nation.</p>

<p>The bill excited much disapproval and was vigorously opposed
in parliament. In the commons the preamble, which acknowledged
the prerogative asserted by the crown, was passed only by
a majority of thirty-six, and the bill was finally carried by 165 to
115. Among its opponents were Burke and Charles Fox, by that
time a power in the house. No man probably has ever enjoyed
greater popularity than Fox. His disposition was amiable and
generous, his good nature inexhaustible, his heart full of warm
and humane feelings. As a mere lad he had been initiated into
vice by his father's folly; he drank, lived loosely, dressed extravagantly,
and was an inveterate and most unlucky gambler;
his losses were indeed too constant to be wholly due to ill-luck.
At twenty-five he owed &pound;140,000, which his father paid for
him. He was a keen sportsman, and he cared for higher things
than sport. He was accomplished, a lover of learning and art,
and found unfailing pleasure in the masterpieces of Greek, Latin,
English, French, Italian, and, in later days, Spanish literature.
In parliament he had hitherto opposed all popular measures,
sometimes with insolent flippancy. He was appointed a lord of
the admiralty in 1770. He gradually came under Burke's influence
and showed signs of remarkable talents in debate. His
speeches were unprepared, his statement of a case was often
made confusedly, but he was splendid in reply. His career as a
statesman was marred, like his private character, by an utter
lack of principle. His opposition to the royal marriage bill
seems to have been a matter of private feeling. His father had
united the plebeian family of Fox with a house descended from
a royal bastard by a runaway marriage with Lady Caroline
Lennox; and Charles was hot against a bill which annulled a
marriage made without legal consent, and must have derived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
special satisfaction in opposing the wish to preserve the royal
family from derogatory marriages on the part of the faithless
lover of his favourite aunt, Lady Sarah. He resigned office,
but re-entered the ministry the following December.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NORTH'S REGULATING ACT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_97" id="TOPIC_97"></a>The strength of the ministry caused a stagnation in matters
of domestic policy, and parliament turned its attention towards a
settlement of the government of India. In 1772 the East India
Company was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing chiefly to
expensive wars, large pensions to native rulers, and the greed of
the proprietors. The successes of Haidar in the Karnatic and
the famine in Bengal sent down the price of stock, as we have
seen, 60 per cent. The company applied to government for a
loan of at least &pound;1,000,000. North, with statesmanlike decision,
seized the opportunity of asserting the right of the crown to
the territorial revenue and of placing the government under the
control of its ministers. The king upheld his policy. Select
and secret committees were appointed by the commons to inquire
into the condition of the company and of the British
affairs in India. Acting on the recommendation of the secret
committee, North foiled an attempt of the company to keep its
affairs in its own hands by carrying a bill to restrain it from
appointing supervisors in India. Burke violently opposed this
and every step by which the territorial power of the company
was brought into subjection to parliament. It was, indeed, with
some justice that he urged that the violation of the royal charter
held by the company was a dangerous precedent, that the claim
to the territorial revenue was arbitrary, and that parliament
had increased the company's distress by extorting from it the
payment of &pound;400,000 a year, and had done nothing for it in
return. The case for the company was supported in both
houses by the Rockingham party generally.</p>

<p>North was supreme in both houses, and, in June 1773, carried
his regulating bill. The company received from government a
loan of &pound;1,400,000 at 4 per cent., its annual payment of &pound;400,000
was remitted until the loan was repaid; its future dividends
were restricted in amount, and its authority in accepting bills
from India curtailed; it was to submit its accounts to the
treasury, and to export British goods to a certain yearly value.
In order to assist the company which had a large stock of tea
on hand, it was agreed that it might export this tea direct and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
duty free to America, a decision which proved of momentous
import. A court of supreme jurisdiction was created, consisting
of a chief justice and three puisne judges, appointed by the
crown and with fixed salaries. The governor of Bengal was
made governor-general of British India and was to act with a
council of four. The first governor-general, Warren Hastings,
then governor of Bengal, and his council were appointed by the
act; their successors were to be appointed by the directors and
approved by the crown. All military and civil matters which
came before the directors were to be submitted to the crown.
No officer of the crown or of the company was to accept any
presents. The act transferred the government of India from a
trading company to the crown. Constitutionally, its weakest
point was the appointment of executive officers in parliament;
for all officers should be appointed by the crown, and its action
should be subject to parliamentary check. As regards the
arrangement of government, the act should have defined the
relations between the supreme court and the council, and between
the governor-general, the directors, and the crown, and should
not have left the governor-general in a position to be overruled
by his council.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_98" id="TOPIC_98"></a>During the debates on these measures the publication of the
report of the select committee excited public feeling against
the "nabobs," and specially against Clive, and a parliamentary
inquiry was held into his conduct. Before the select committee
he admitted and defended the deceit which he had practised on
Omichand in 1757, and declared that he was justified in accepting
enormous sums from M&iacute;r Jafar. They were as nothing
compared to what he might have had; "Mr. Chairman," said
he, "at this moment I stand astonished at my own moderation".
Resolutions condemning his conduct were moved by Burgoyne.
He defended himself with force and dignity. Finally, after many
debates, the house voted that he had through the power entrusted
to him possessed himself of &pound;234,000, refused to vote that he
had abused his power, and voted instead that "he did at the
same time render great and meritorious services to this country".
The matter was not made a party question, and the decision
was worthy of the assembly which pronounced it. The king,
while fully acknowledging Clive's services, thought him guilty
of "rapine," and disapproved of his virtual acquittal. Thurlow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
attacked, Wedderburn zealously defended him. The court party
voted different ways. Physical suffering together with the strain
of these proceedings affected Clive's mind, and he died by his
own hand on November 22, 1774.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S POLITICAL PREDOMINANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_99" id="TOPIC_99"></a>In 1773 the king's political predominance was firmly established.
His will was law to his ministers, and they commanded
overwhelming majorities in both houses of parliament. The
country was satisfied that it should be so, for the quarrel
between the people and parliament had died out. It was a
time of political apathy. The balance of power, which during
Walpole's administration had shifted from the lords to the
commons, was shifting from parliament to the crown. The
house of commons was losing its spirit of independence, and the
control which it should have exercised on the executive was
endangered by the growth of the king's personal authority. So
long as George ruled the country successfully this danger was
likely to increase. He had so skilfully strengthened his position
that he had triumphed over domestic agitation. The just working
of the constitution was finally restored through national
calamity. American discontents were to lead to a revolt which
the enemies of England used as an opportunity for attacking
her. Their attacks were formidable in themselves, and had the
humiliating result of forcing Great Britain to give up the
struggle with her revolted colonies and acknowledge their independence.
George had chosen to be his own prime minister,
and his policy was to suffer defeat. A period of storm was
ahead, and as the ship of state passed through it, the king's
personal rule, and much else besides, went overboard. All this
was still far off. From 1770 to 1774 the affairs of the American
colonies excited little attention in England, though, as we shall
see in the next chapter, they were tending towards open revolt.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>THE QUARREL WITH AMERICA.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_100" id="TOPIC_100"></a>The failure of the non-importation agreements in 1770 led
Englishmen to expect a peaceable end to the quarrel with
America, and the colonists were for the most part inclined to let
it die out. Samuel Adams had no such inclination, and did all
in his power to fan the smouldering embers of strife. For
some time longer he and his friends professed loyalty, but he
at least was consciously working for separation. A rising in
North Carolina, called the regulators' war, because the insurgents
claimed to regulate their own police affairs, was smartly quelled
by the governor, Tryon, in 1771; it need not detain us, for it
had no connexion with the quarrel with England. There was
much lawlessness elsewhere. Mobs tyrannised over their more
loyal neighbours, tarring and feathering some of those who
would not comply with their demands, and using other barbarous
modes of advancing the cause of liberty. In Boston the revenue
officers were exposed to insult and violence. Hutchinson held
the assembly of the province at Cambridge, and further disgusted
his opponents by informing them that he was no longer
dependent on their votes for his salary; it would thenceforward
be paid by the king. The more peaceable Americans were
gratified in 1772 by the appointment of the Earl of Dartmouth
to succeed Hillsborough as secretary for the colonies, for Dartmouth,
a pious and amiable person of no political ability, was
known to be anxious for conciliation. Fresh cause of offence,
however, was found in a decision of the ministers that the
salaries of the Massachusetts judges should be paid by the
crown instead of by the colony. This change, which was designed
to render the judges independent of popular feeling, was
resented as an attempt to make them subservient to the crown,
for they held office during the king's pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HUTCHINSON'S LETTERS.</i></div>

<p>Meanwhile the contempt with which the authority of the
crown was regarded, and the necessity for restraining the provincial
judges from political partisanship, were forcibly illustrated.
Smuggling was carried on freely, especially in Rhode
Island. The duty of preventing it in Narragansett Bay was discharged
by Lieutenant Duddingston, in command of the <i>Gaspee</i>
schooner. He was zealous, and, according to American accounts,
was guilty of illegal and oppressive acts. On June 9, while engaged
in a chase, the <i>Gaspee</i> ran aground, and on the night of the
10th was boarded by eight boat-loads of men. Duddingston
was treacherously shot at and wounded; he and his men were
set on shore, and the schooner was burnt. This destruction of
one of the king's ships, an act alike of rebellion and piracy, and,
as Thurlow said, "an event five times the magnitude of the stamp
act," was unpunished. A law, enacted in the previous April,
and evoked by a fire in an English dockyard, provided that the
setting on fire of a public dockyard or a king's ship should be
felony, and that those accused of such an offence should be tried
in England. Commissioners were appointed by the crown to
inquire into the destruction of the <i>Gaspee</i>, and send those
concerned in it to England for trial. On their applying for
warrants to the chief justice of the province, he declared that he
would allow no one to be arrested with a view to deportation,
and the commission was fruitless. The colonists were angered
by this attempt to enforce the law; and in 1773 took an important
step towards union and a future congress by establishing
committees of correspondence between the provinces.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_101" id="TOPIC_101"></a>Samuel Adams unexpectedly found an opportunity of rousing
fresh excitement in Massachusetts. A number of private
letters written by Hutchinson and Oliver, the deputy governor, to
a gentleman of England, named Whately, and stolen after his
death, were sent over by Franklin to the committee of correspondence
at Boston, were read by Adams to the assembly, and
were subsequently published. Hutchinson, a patriotic American,
was a faithful servant of the crown and believed in the
supremacy of parliament. His letters contained no statements
that were not true and no comments discreditable to a man
of honour, holding the opinions on which he had consistently
acted. They were declared to be evidences of malice and bad
faith; he and Oliver were, John Adams said, "cool-thinking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
deliberate villains," and the assembly sent a petition to the
king for their removal. The letters were industriously circulated
throughout the province, and were denounced by preachers
in their Sunday sermons. Such was the state of affairs when,
in accordance with the act of parliament authorising the East
India Company to export its surplus stock of tea direct to
America, three ships laden with tea appeared in Boston harbour.
Other ships with like cargoes had also been despatched to
New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston. At Boston, on the
night of December 16, a large body of men, disguised as Indians
and encouraged by Samuel Adams and his friends, boarded the
ships and emptied their cargoes, 340 chests of tea valued at
&pound;18,000, into the sea. The ships for Philadelphia and New
York returned to London without discharging their cargoes.
At Charleston the tea was landed, but the consignees were forced
to renounce their engagement, and the tea rotted in the cellars of
the custom-house.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_102" id="TOPIC_102"></a>In England the Boston riot caused much irritation. The
news came when the publication of Hutchinson's letters was exciting
strong feelings. Who was responsible for their abstraction
from Whately's correspondence was for some time a mystery.
Franklin kept his counsel, and a duel took place between
Whately's brother and a Bostonian who was suspected of stealing
them. Then Franklin declared that he alone had obtained
them and sent them to Boston. As agent for Massachusetts he
appeared before a committee of the privy council on January 29,
1774, in support of the petition against Hutchinson and Oliver.
Both sides were heard by counsel. Wedderburn, who spoke
against the petition, made a violent attack on Franklin; he
described him as a thief and accused him of acting from the
meanest motives. The temper of his audience was irritated
by the news from Boston, and his speech was received with
manifestations of delight, indecent on the part of men sitting as
judges in that august court. The petition was rejected as groundless
and scandalous, and men went away "almost ready to throw
up their hats for joy," as though a lawyer's bitter tongue had
given England a victory. Franklin was at once dismissed from
his office of deputy postmaster. Wedderburn's speech and the
spirit in which it was received were impolitic as well as discreditable.
While strongly opposed to the ministerial policy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
America, Franklin had shown himself anxious to maintain the
tie between Great Britain and her colonies. This attack upon
his character made him one of England's enemies, and, as it
proved, one of the most dangerous of them. His conduct is not
palliated by the indecency of his opponents. It has been urged
in his defence that, as Whately had shown the letters to certain
English politicians, it was fair that Boston politicians should also
see them, that as agent he was bound to do the best for his province,
and that governments did intercept and use correspondence
which was believed to contain important political information.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Conduct befitting a man of honour needs no defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FOX DISMISSED FROM OFFICE.</i></div>

<p>The general opinion in England was that Boston should be
punished, and that if the government made an example of that
rebellious town, the Americans would learn a wholesome lesson.
The king held this opinion, and was delighted when General
Gage told him that the Americans "would be lions whilst we
are lambs, but if we take the resolute part they will undoubtedly
prove very meek". He determined to force Boston to submission,
and his ministers were at his command. A junior lord
of the treasury was insubordinate, and was promptly dismissed.
It seemed a small matter, but it had important consequences, for
the rebel was Charles Fox. He had more than one grudge
against the king, and he was perhaps growing impatient of
serving under a minister who was virtually the king's representative,
though his actual revolt may have been an unpremeditated
ebullition of youthful vanity. A libel on the speaker, of which
the turbulent parson, Horne, was the author, gave him an
opportunity for self-display; he usurped the functions of leader
of the house, persuaded it to enter on proceedings which might
have ended in another awkward quarrel with a printer, and placed
North in a most embarrassing position. The king, whom he
had already offended by his opposition to the royal marriage
bill, heartily disliked him, and urged North to get rid of him.
He was curtly dismissed from office on February 24. He at
once went into opposition, and acted generally with the Rockingham
party, though he did not distinctly join it until a later period.
He was already intimate with Burke, who soon gained much
influence over him. On almost every question he combated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
opinions which he had previously supported, and constantly attacked
his former chief with great bitterness. In debate the
opposition gained enormously by his alliance, but it was in the
end injurious to their cause. His sympathy with the enemies
of his country in time of war strengthened the king and his
ministers in their efforts to maintain the honour of England by
persevering in the struggle, for it revolted the patriotic feelings of
the nation and kept it steadfast in its support of the government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PENAL ACTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_103" id="TOPIC_103"></a>On March 14 North began to lay before the commons the
measures by which the government hoped to bring the Americans
to submission. By the first of these penal laws, as they
are called, Boston was to be punished by the transference of the
seat of government to Salem, and by the closing of its harbour,
which entailed the suspension of its trade, until the town had
made good the loss inflicted on the East India Company, and
the king was satisfied that the laws would be observed. North
spoke with remarkable moderation. Both he and Dartmouth
disliked violent measures, and their tone with regard to America
was so different from that of their colleagues, that it indicated
a division in the cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The bill met with little opposition
in the commons, though Dowdeswell and Burke spoke against
it. In the lords, Rockingham and Shelburne opposed it, Chatham
was absent through ill-health, and Mansfield strongly advocated
it, declaring that Boston had committed "the last overt act of
treason," and that it was a lucky event, for if the bill passed
we should have crossed the Rubicon, the Americans would see
that we would temporise no longer, and if it passed unanimously,
Boston would submit without bloodshed. The bill passed both
houses without a division. The next bill, "for regulating the
government of Massachusetts Bay," overthrew the charter of
the colony; it increased the power of the governor, vested the
nomination of the council in the crown, altered the system by
which juries were chosen, and prohibited town meetings, the
principal engine of democratic rule, from being held without
the consent of the governor. The abrogation of chartered rights
excited strong, though ineffectual, opposition; the bill was passed
in the commons by 239 to 64, and in the lords by 92 to 20,
eleven peers signing a protest against it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>This measure was calculated to alarm and irritate the colonies
generally, for the alteration of the charter of one of them would
be taken as a menace to the constitutional liberties of all. In
the hope of counteracting this effect, the opposition wished the
house of commons, before it passed the bill, to conciliate the
Americans by repealing the tax on tea.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> A motion was made
for the repeal on April 19, and was supported by Burke in a
speech of remarkable power. He maintained that the concession
would be well received, and entreated the house to resort
to its old principles, to be content to bind the colonies by laws
of trade, to disregard the question of its right, and to refrain
from taxation. Only forty-nine voted for the motion. A third
bill ordered that any one accused of a capital offence should, if
the act was done in the execution of the law in Massachusetts,
be tried in Nova Scotia or Great Britain; and a fourth provided
for the quartering of troops. When the quartering bill was
before the lords, Chatham returned to parliament. He opposed
the bill, declared his dislike of the Boston port bill, which, he
said, punished a whole town for the crime of a few; and while
he condemned the turbulence of the Americans, declared that
their discontent was due to the irritating treatment they had
received, and urged that England should act towards them as a
fond and forgiving parent, for the time was at hand when she
would "need the help of her most distant friends". On all
these bills the numbers of the minority were very low, and the
king declared himself "infinitely pleased" with the reception
they met with. Meanwhile Hutchinson was recalled, and Gage
was appointed governor of Massachusetts as well as commander-in-chief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE QUEBEC ACT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_104" id="TOPIC_104"></a>Another bill, closely connected with the state of affairs in
America, though not devised merely with reference to it, provided
for the government of Canada, which had remained as it
had been settled temporarily by royal proclamation in 1763. The
province of Quebec, as it was called, only extended eastward
to the St. John's river on the north of the St. Lawrence, the
territory beyond being annexed to the jurisdiction of Newfoundland,
while on the south the islands of Cape Breton and St.
John (Prince Edward's island) belonged to Nova Scotia. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
settlement was made as to the country west of the Appalachian
range, which was claimed by the old colonies, nor as to the vast
tract between Lake Nipissing and the Mississippi, the boundary
of the Spanish land. The government of Canada was in the
hands of a military governor-general and a council. In 1764 the
English-speaking and protestant population was a mere handful;
in 1774 it numbered about 360, while the French Roman
catholics were at the least 80,000. In accordance with the treaty
of Paris the catholics had full liberty of worship. English was,
however, the only official language, and all offices were held by
men of British nationality. The administration of the law was confused,
and, though the king's proclamation held out a prospect
that an assembly might be called, it required oaths and declarations
which would have shut Roman catholics out from it. The
French disliked the English law with reference to land, and as
far as possible evaded it. Constant difficulties arose, and, in
1766, Charles Yorke, then attorney-general, advised that English
should cease to be the only official language, and that French
law should be recognised in cases which concerned land. On
the other hand the British minority, largely consisting of immigrants
from New England, pressed for an assembly, which would
have strengthened and perpetuated their supremacy over their
French neighbours.</p>

<p>The discontent in the American colonies made the ministers
specially anxious to conciliate the French Canadians, and with
the advice of Sir Guy Carleton, the governor, they brought in a
bill for the government of the province. The Quebec act of
1774 included in Canada the territory previously annexed to
Newfoundland, and extended its boundaries to the Ohio and the
Mississippi. It confirmed freedom of worship to the Roman
catholics and secured to their priests, with the exception of the
religious orders, their former tithes and dues, so far as concerned
their own people only, for protestants were exempted from such
payments. Civil cases were to be decided according to the
French law, criminal cases according to the English law, by
juries. It was declared inexpedient to call an assembly; a
legislative council was nominated by the crown, and taxation
was reserved to the parliament of Great Britain. The bill was
strenuously opposed, Chatham in the lords, and Burke and
Barr&eacute; in the commons speaking strongly against it. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
government, it was urged, was setting up a despotism and was
depressing the British population to please the French <i>noblesse</i>,
and the trial of civil cases without juries and the withholding of
the <i>habeas corpus</i> were represented as intolerable grievances.</p>

<p>The conflict was hottest on the religious question. The
whigs, who secured the support of the dissenters by posing as
the protestant party, had a hereditary claim to the popular
cry of No popery. They denounced the bill as establishing
popery, while it merely permitted protestantism. It was,
Chatham declared, a breach of the reformation, of the revolution,
and of the king's coronation oath. The City petitioned
against the bill, and when, on June 22, the king went to give his
assent to it and to prorogue parliament, he was received in the
streets with angry cries of "No popery". The agitation soon
died out, for the government was popular. In America the act
caused much irritation; New York, Virginia, and other colonies
complained that it deprived them of the right to extend their
territories; the revolutionary party saw with uneasiness the
establishment of the power of the crown over a vast district
on their borders, and religious prejudices were aroused by the
favour shown to the catholics. Strong protestant as he was,
the king was thoroughly in favour of the bill. It was a wise
and a just measure. It gave the French Canadians all that they
really needed: they thought it absurd that rights to land should
be decided by juries; they had no political ambitions, and only
desired to enjoy in peace the ministrations of their own priests
and the right to deal with their lands according to their ancient
customs. They rejoiced that their priests were satisfied, and in
the coming struggle between Great Britain and her colonies the
priests were mindful of the justice with which they were treated
and used their boundless influence with good effect on the
British side.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_105" id="TOPIC_105"></a>The Rubicon, as Mansfield said, was passed, but the event
was to be different from the expectation of the king and the
nation at large. When Gage went out to enforce the repressive
acts neither he nor those who sent him thought that his
task would be hard. Four regiments, he believed, would be
enough to settle the business. The Americans, Sandwich said,
were cowardly and undisciplined; they would not stand a cannon-shot.
That they would not fight was the firm opinion of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
but a very few. More than this, it was generally expected that
Massachusetts would not be supported by the other colonies,
and no special military preparation was thought necessary. On
June 1, Boston harbour was closed. The busy little town lay
desolate, its wharfs were deserted, its warehouses shut up, its
streets silent; its merchants were threatened with ruin, its seamen,
shipwrights, and labourers and their families with starvation.
The act was enforced to the utmost, and small as Gage's force
was, it was sufficient to keep the town in subjection. Its
punishment was heavy, but surely not heavier than its offences.
Be this as it may, it was worse than ineffectual. The penal
acts irritated the Americans and did not intimidate them. Boston
was regarded as suffering for the common cause. Supplies
poured in from the towns and villages of New England, from the
Carolinas, Virginia, and Maryland; and a continental congress
was decided on. Encouraged by the prospect of support, the
revolutionary party in Massachusetts defied Gage's authority;
gatherings of armed men took place, and warlike preparations
were set on foot. Gage began to fortify Boston Neck and
brought in some guns which might otherwise have been seized
by the people.</p>

<p>On September 5 the continental congress met at Philadelphia.
Of the thirteen colonies only Georgia was unrepresented. Yet
the delegates came with different instructions and different intentions,
and even among delegates from the same province
there was much difference of opinion. As a body the congress
did not meet with any predetermined revolutionary purpose.
Many loyalists and indeed moderate men of both parties believed
that it would be a means of arranging a reconciliation with
Great Britain, and though the most decided loyalists would have
nothing to do with it, even they hoped for a good result:<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> one-third
of the delegates, John Adams said, were whigs, one-third
tories (loyalists), and the rest mongrel. A proposal for a new
constitution with a president over all the colonies to be appointed
by the crown, and a grand council to be elected by the several
assemblies and to act in connexion with parliament, was only
negatived by the votes of six colonies to five. Yet the revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>tionists
gained a decided preponderance, largely through the
skilful management of Samuel Adams, who persuaded the congress
to approve the "resolves" passed at a meeting of Suffolk
county, Massachusetts. These "resolves" rejected the act for
the government of the province, required tax collectors not to
pay money into the governor's treasury, and advised towns to
appoint their own officers of militia. Besides endorsing a policy
of armed resistance to government, congress further demanded
the revocation of a series of acts of parliament, including the
Quebec act and the late penal legislation, drew up a declaration
of rights, agreed on non-exportation and non-importation, sent
a petition to the king, and published an address to the English
people. It arranged that a new congress should meet the
following May, and invited the Canadians to join in it, suggesting
grounds of discontent with the English government and
pretending a zeal for religious equality. But the Canadians were
not to be caught.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AMERICAN LOYALISM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_106" id="TOPIC_106"></a>Congress separated without having laid down any basis for
conciliation save complete surrender on the part of parliament,
which was clearly impossible. It professed loyalty to the crown,
and it is probable that certain eminent Americans, who, like
George Washington, declared that they knew of no wish for
independence, really desired to maintain the connexion with
England, if they could bring affairs back to their condition
before 1763, and actually believed that by cutting off commercial
relations with her, they could compel her to assent to their
demands without an appeal to arms. Like the vast majority of
Englishmen, who did not believe that the Americans would fight,
they failed to understand the situation. In the case of others,
like Patrick Henry and the Adamses, it is useless to attach any
weight to loyal expressions. Too much, indeed, has been made
of the American professions of loyalty, for men's loyalty is
better judged by their actions than by their words. Thousands
of Americans proved their loyalty by tremendous sacrifices.
Loyalism on its religious side was connected with the teaching
of the English Church; politically it was the outcome of attachment
to law, monarchy, and the unity of the empire as against
revolution, democracy, and separation.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The loyalists, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
included men of various religious persuasions and of different
shades of political opinion. As Americans, they felt the British
colonial system burdensome, and only the more extreme among
them approved of the stamp act and the Townshend duties.
Many took the American view of the rights of the colonies;
they desired reforms and redress of grievances, and some of
them were not averse from the milder forms of resistance. Yet
all were loyal to the crown and acknowledged the supremacy
of parliament. The hopes of the moderate section were disappointed
by the congress of 1774; in common with the more
extreme loyalists they held that it exceeded its powers, and
their denial of its authority united the loyalist party.</p>

<p>The loyalists, or tories as they were called, comprised, in
addition to the royal officers, many of the best and most cultivated
people in the colonies, a majority of the larger landowners,
by far the greater number of the episcopal clergy together
with some other religious teachers, very many physicians, fewer
lawyers, though some of the most eminent among them, and
many of the wealthier merchants, who disliked the interruption
of trade and believed that its prosperity depended on British
commerce. Among the lower classes some farmers, mechanics,
and labourers were loyalists. They were weakest in New
England, though fairly numerous in Connecticut. New York
was throughout the loyalist stronghold, and, of the other
middle colonies, Pennsylvania was disinclined to revolution
and New Jersey contained a strong loyalist minority. In the
southern colonies they were about as numerous as the whigs,
and in South Carolina and Georgia perhaps outnumbered them.
John Adams, who would be inclined to underestimate their
number, thought that they were a third of the population of the
thirteen colonies. The number on each side fluctuated from
time to time; the loyalists claimed to be in a majority, and it
is probable that at least half of the most respected part of the
population were throughout the struggle either avowedly or
secretly averse from revolution.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> At the lowest computation
20,000 loyalists joined the British army, and some thirty regiments
or battalions of them were regularly organised and paid.
Most of them were peaceable men, not more inclined for fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ing
than the mass of their opponents who were forced into war
by an active minority. Through the skilful management of this
minority the loyalists were disarmed everywhere at the beginning
of the struggle. They suffered terrible persecution. A man
suspected of loyalism would be summoned to a meeting of the
"sons of liberty," and ordered to take an oath to them. If he
refused he was tarred and feathered, or set to ride upon a rail,
and his house was defiled with filth. Loyalists were declared
liable to imprisonment, exile, and confiscation. These men were
not less patriotic than the revolutionists; they believed that the
welfare of their country depended on its remaining part of the
British empire; and holding this belief they suffered, fought, and
died for their country's sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A GENERAL ELECTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_107" id="TOPIC_107"></a>Although parliament had not lasted its full term of seven
years, it was dissolved on September 30. The king was probably
anxious that a new parliament should be elected before any
event took place which might suggest doubt as to the success
of his American policy. Besides, he was anxious to secure more
men of landed property as members, and reckoned that a sudden
dissolution would foil "the nabobs, planters, and other volunteers,"
who would not be ready for the battle.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> His design was successful,
and the election as a whole was marked by the predominance
of the country gentlemen, at that period the best element in a
house of commons. Much to George's annoyance the Grenville
election act had been made perpetual during the last session.
Its good effects were apparent in the election of 1774; it made
the bribery of borough electors dangerous, and there was far
less of it than before. Bargains, however, could still be made
with the owners and patrons of boroughs, and the king made
himself responsible for the money North expended. North
offered Lord Falmouth &pound;2,500 a piece for three Cornish seats
and had "to make it guineas". Other bargains of the same
kind were made. George, who was great at electioneering
man&oelig;uvres, took much interest in the proceedings. He was
unable to find a candidate to stand against Wilkes, then lord
mayor elect, and Wilkes and Glynn were returned for Middlesex
without opposition. Wilkes took his seat without encountering
any difficulties and his political importance virtually ended with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
his exclusion. Bristol returned Burke, who was recommended
to that great commercial city by his desire for conciliation with
America, and his knowledge of mercantile affairs. At the
declaration of the poll he dwelt on the relations which should
exist between a member and his constituents: he should, he
said, as their representative in all cases prefer their interests to
his own, but he should not sacrifice his mature judgment to their
opinion, or be subservient to their mandates. As a whole the
election satisfied the king, for the ministers had a large and
indeed an increased majority.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_108" id="TOPIC_108"></a>"I am not sorry," George wrote on hearing of the proceedings
of congress, "that the line of conduct seems now chalked out; the
New England colonies are in a state of rebellion, blows must
decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent."
He expressed the feeling of by far the larger part of
his people. Not of all, for his ministers North and Dartmouth
and a few of their party, were averse from violent measures; the
merchants who traded with America were anxious for conciliation;
and the whigs as a body were opposed to the king's policy.
Chatham exulted in "the manly wisdom and calm resolution of
congress". The experience and sentiments of his great days
led him to foresee that, in case of war France and Spain would
seize the opportunity of attacking England. Unfortunately his
theory that the colonies owed only a limited obedience to the
crown, that while parliament had a right to crush disobedience
and to pass acts regulating trade, it had no right to impose
taxes, his violence, his inveterate habit of "talking fustian,"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and
his friendship with Franklin, who was commonly regarded as a
rebel, deprived his warnings of the weight which they deserved.
The Rockingham party did not act cordially with him. It was
inspired by Burke who urged that parliament should disregard
the question of right, should act in accordance with the spirit
rather than the letter of the constitution, should respect a desire
for free institutions, and should be guided by what was practicable
and what was advisable, specially with reference to England's
trade. His influence was somewhat injured by the fact that
since 1771 he had been the paid agent of the province of
New York. Equally with Chatham, he considered that colonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
trade and industry should be restrained in order to bring wealth
to the mother-country, nor does either of them seem to have
perceived that the root of American discontent lay in these
restrictions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CRISIS UNDER-ESTIMATED.</i></div>

<p>It was not until 1776 that Adam Smith in his famous <i>Wealth
of Nations</i> showed that such restrictions were actually injurious
to the prosperity of the country which imposed them, and combated
the theories on which the relations of England with her
colonies had been built up. He desired that the colonies should
be represented in parliament, a proposal which found some
advocates both here and in America, but was condemned by
Burke and did not enter into practical politics. Meanwhile a
pamphleteer of originality and genius, Tucker, Dean of Gloucester,
maintained that separation was inevitable and advisable,
that the Americans were a turbulent and ill-conditioned people,
a source of expense to which they would not contribute, and that
England would be better off without them. She would not, he
contended, lose commercially; for, like Adam Smith, he pointed
out that trade goes to the best market, and that so long as
England remained superior to other countries in capital and
industry, she would keep the American trade, and, as war was
destructive of trade, he would have had her separate herself
peacefully from her rebellious colonies. His proposal was denounced
by Burke and found no acceptance with either party in
England.</p>

<p>Numerically weak as the opposition in parliament was, it
made a vigorous fight over American affairs. Parliament opened
on November 30, and the king's speech took note of the resistance
to the law which prevailed in Massachusetts, and the "unwarrantable
combinations for the obstruction" of trade. In both
houses an amendment to the address was proposed. The divisions
illustrate the strength of the two parties; in the lords it was
defeated by 63 to 13, and in the commons by 264 to 73. The
ministers asserted that the force already in America was sufficient
to bring the colonies to obedience; the naval establishment was
reduced to a peace footing, and no extra soldiers were voted.
Gage, however, who had only some 3,000 troops, asked for a
large reinforcement, and wrote that, if matters came to an
extremity, 20,000 men would be needed for the conquest of
New England, a number which, Dartmouth said, "the nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
would not be able to furnish in a twelvemonth".<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The ministers
resolved to send a small reinforcement from Ireland, they were
encouraged to believe that the Americans would yield by tidings
that the New York assembly had rejected the decisions of
congress and by more hopeful news from Gage. After the
recess the campaign opened in earnest. On January 20, 1775,
Chatham moved for the recall of the troops from Boston, and
declared that, if the ministers persisted in their policy, they
would mislead the king and the kingdom would be undone.
He was defeated by a large majority. Petitions against coercion
were presented from London, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow, and
other trading towns, and were virtually shelved. Meanwhile
Lord Howe, encouraged by the dislike of North and Dartmouth
to coercive measures, made ineffectual attempts to arrange terms
of conciliation through Franklin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONCILIATORY RESOLUTIONS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_109" id="TOPIC_109"></a>On February 1 Chatham, who was in constant communication
with Franklin, brought in a conciliation bill. It was a
strange composition, florid in terms, embracing a multiplicity of
subjects, and depending for its operation on the good-will of the
Americans. He proposed to assert the supremacy of parliament,
specially in matters of trade, to confine taxation to the provincial
assemblies, and to legalise the coming congress in order that it
might make a perpetual free grant to the crown, which was to be
appropriated by parliament to the reduction of the national debt.
Having obtained this grant, parliament was to reduce the power
of the admiralty courts, which checked illicit trading, and to
suspend all the acts, including the Quebec act, of which the
Americans complained. The bill was not allowed a second
reading. Soon after its ignominious rejection the gout laid hold
on Chatham, and he did not appear in parliament again for
two years. Franklin returned to America about this time; he
disclaimed responsibility for Chatham's proposals, which, he
considered, would only have been useful as a basis for future
arrangement. North at last informed parliament of the threatening
state of affairs. Massachusetts was declared in rebellion;
votes were passed for 2,000 additional seamen and about 4,400
soldiers; it was resolved to increase the force at Boston to
10,000 men; and a bill was passed confining the commerce of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the New England provinces to Great Britain and the West
Indies, and shutting them out from the Newfoundland fishery.
These restraints, which were evoked by the American non-intercourse
agreements, were soon extended to five other provinces.</p>

<p>While George promoted these strong measures, he willingly
fell in with North's desire to "hold out the olive-branch"; and
on the 20th North moved a resolution to the effect that if any
colony provided what parliament considered its fair proportion
towards the common defence and the expenses of its civil administration,
no duty or tax should be imposed upon it, except
for the regulation of trade. His proposal excited the indignation
of the high prerogative party, who thought themselves betrayed;
his followers rose in revolt; "the treasury bench seemed to
totter". The storm was stilled at last, and then Barr&eacute;, Burke,
and Dunning fell upon the bill, describing it as a mean attempt
to divide the Americans, and a plan for coercing each province
separately. The motion was, however, carried. As the opposition
scorned North's plan, which Burke called "a project of
ransom by auction," it behoved them to bring forward a plan of
their own which would be acceptable to the Americans. Accordingly,
on March 22, Burke propounded a series of conciliatory
resolutions which he enforced in one of his most famous speeches.
He urged the house to return to its old policy, to respect the
Americans' love of freedom, to look to the colonial assemblies
to supply the expenses of their government and defence, to
abandon the futile attempt to impose taxation, and to extend
to Americans the privileges of Englishmen. His proposal was
defeated. Nevertheless, by accepting North's resolution parliament
showed a desire for pacification. The resolution proposed
a compromise; while it maintained the authority of parliament,
it offered the Americans self-taxation. It was made with a
sincere desire to end the quarrel. At one time it might have
led to pacification, but it came too late.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_110" id="TOPIC_110"></a>Gage found the fortification of Boston Neck no easy matter;
the people would not sell him materials, and somehow his barges
sank, his waggons were bogged, and their loads caught fire.
The work was finished at last, and with his small force he could
do little else. In Rhode Island the people seized the cannon
mounted for the defence of the harbour, and in New Hampshire
they surprised a small fort, and carried off ordnance and stores.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Manufactories of arms and powder-mills were set up in different
places. In February, 1775, the Massachusetts provincial congress
met, and urged the militia, and specially the "minute-men"&mdash;militiamen
ready to serve on the shortest notice&mdash;to perfect
their discipline. Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas were
astir with warlike preparations; in Massachusetts men were
practising the use of arms on every village green, a number of
Stockbridge Indians were enlisted as minute-men, and efforts
were made to induce the Six Nations to "whet the hatchet"
against the English.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Express-riders kept the country people
well supplied with intelligence, in order that they might anticipate
any projected movement of the British troops. On the
26th Gage sent a detachment to Salem to bring in some guns,
but the people removed them in time. Some opposition was
offered to the troops, but they were kept well in hand and no
blood was shed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SKIRMISH AT LEXINGTON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_111" id="TOPIC_111"></a>He determined to be beforehand at Concord, where the
provincials had gathered a quantity of military stores, and on
April 18 sent some companies of grenadiers and light infantry
under Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn to destroy them.
They went by night up the Charles river in boats, landed, and
began their march. The alarm had been given and the country
was aroused. When they arrived at Lexington at 5 in the
morning of the 19th they found a body of militia on the green.
"Disperse, you rebels!" shouted Pitcairn, and the troops advanced
with a cheer. As the militia dispersed some shots were fired.
From which side the first shot came is not clear. A soldier
was hit and Pitcairn's horse was wounded. The troops fired a
volley, a few militiamen were killed and others wounded, and
the soldiers marched on. While the grenadiers were destroying
the stores at Concord a sharp engagement took place with the
militia, and several on both sides were killed and wounded. The
troops, having accomplished their purpose as far as was possible,
for part of the stores had already been removed, set out to return
to Boston. As they marched back, tired and impeded by their
wounded, militiamen and volunteers fired upon them from every
hedge, and wall, and house, and the shots told heavily on their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
close ranks. Forced on by the ceaseless fire, like a driven flock
of sheep, thick together and helpless, they staggered back to
Lexington, where they arrived completely exhausted. There
they were met by a large detachment under Lord Percy, which
had been sent to their relief. After a rest the whole body
marched back, harassed all the way by an incessant fire from
cover, which they were for the most part unable to return. The
British loss was sixty-five killed, about 157 wounded, and a few
missing; the American casualties are stated as ninety-three in
all. Not, unhappily, for the last time did our soldiers find that
farmers and the like, who know their country, are accustomed to
shoot, and understand the importance of taking cover, may be
more than a match for brave and disciplined soldiers with no
knowledge of war save the drill of a parade ground. It was
evident that there was fighting stuff in the Americans, that they
had some good marksmen, and that, undisciplined as they were,
like the Boers of our own day, they knew how to use such
advantages as they possessed.</p>

<p>Thus was the first blood shed in this long quarrel. The
revolution was begun. Sooner or later it must have come,
though the date of its coming and the violent means by which
it was accomplished were decided by individual action. The
spirit which underlay it can be traced with growing distinctness
since 1690; it was a spirit of independence, puritan in religion
and republican in politics, impatient of control, self-assertive, and
disposed to opposition. It was irritated by restraints on industry
and commerce, and found opportunities for expression in a system
which gave the colonies representative assemblies while it
withheld rights of self-government. Great Britain has since then
adopted a more enlightened colonial policy; yet the statesmen of
past times are not to be condemned because they were men of
their own days and lacked the experience of a future age. And
it is to be remembered that England's colonial policy was then,
as it is now, the most liberal in the world. American discontent
existed before the reign of George III.; it was kept in check
by the fear of French invasion. It was when that fear was
removed that England began to enforce the restraints on commerce.
This change in policy fell most heavily on the New
England provinces, where whig tendencies were strongest, and
specially on Massachusetts. A small and violent party in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
province fanned the flame of discontent, and the attempts at
taxation, which added to the grievances of the colonists, afforded
a respectable cry to the fomenters of resistance. Their work
was aided by the apprehension aroused in the minds of their
fellow-countrymen, by the increase in the part played by the
prerogative, and by the predominance of the tories in England.
While men in other provinces, as Patrick Henry in Virginia,
worked in sympathy with Samuel Adams and his associates, the
revolution was at its outset engineered at Boston, and was
immediately determined by the quarrel between Great Britain
and Massachusetts. In the events which led to the revolution
the British government appears to have shown a short-sighted
insistence on legal rights and a contemptuous disregard of the
sentiments and opinions of the colonists; the revolutionists
generally a turbulent, insolent, and unreasonable temper.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>THE COLONIAL REBELLION.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_112" id="TOPIC_112"></a>Scarcely had the night passed after the skirmish at Lexington
before the whole of Massachusetts was in arms. The provincial
assembly voted that an army of 30,000 men should be raised
in New England, fixed on Cambridge as its headquarters and
sent to their neighbours for support. From New Hampshire,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island the answer was prompt.
Numerous bands of volunteers marched to join the forces of
Massachusetts, and an army of 16,000 men soon invested
Boston from the Mystic river to Roxbury. It was an army
without unity, for the troops of each colony acted under their
own leaders; and its numbers varied from day to day, the
Massachusetts volunteers, who formed its principal part, taking
leave of absence whenever they chose. Many of the provincials
had seen service against the French, and understood a soldier's
work, and many more had received some training in the militia,
but the mass of the volunteers had no military experience or
discipline. Yet they were men well used to shoot and to handle
the spade and axe, implements of first-rate importance in war;
they belonged as a whole to a higher class than the privates
of the British army, they were more resourceful and intelligent,
and were able to obtain provisions and other supplies without
difficulty. Such as they were, Gage judged them too formidable
in number for him to attack. The neck of land which joins
Boston to the continent had been fortified so strongly that the
provincials could not hope to storm it, and he decided to remain
behind it and await the arrival of the reinforcements which
were already on their way. He made no effort to prevent the
insurgents from shutting up his army on the landward side, and
early in May they began to form entrenchments. At the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
time they took measures to distress the beleaguered force by
clearing off the live-stock, hay, and other supplies from the
islands in the harbour. Gage tried in vain to stop them, and
there were several skirmishes in the harbour, in which the
British suffered more heavily than the provincials.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_113" id="TOPIC_113"></a>The insurgents were not content with fighting on their own
ground. The command of the line of the Hudson would prevent
the British from cutting off New England from the middle
colonies, would secure New York from attack from the north,
and would open a way for an invasion of Canada. On the
north the approaches to the river were dominated by the forts
of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, which had played a conspicuous
part in the great war with France; and in them were
laid up some 200 cannon, small arms, and other military stores.
Important as these forts were, no adequate garrisons were maintained
in them. Benedict Arnold, the leader of a band of
volunteers from New Haven, Connecticut, a druggist and West
India trader, was informed of their defenceless condition, and
made an offer to the Massachusetts committee of safety to
capture them. His offer was accepted, and he was authorised to
raise a force. The same plan had been formed in Connecticut;
and Ethan Allen, the leader of an association in Vermont, was
sent with his followers to carry it out. Arnold met him on the
march; he refused to yield the command, and Arnold joined
his force, which included a body of Indians. At dawn on May
10 they surprised the garrison of Ticonderoga, consisting of less
than fifty men, and compelled the governor to surrender without
striking a blow. A detachment from the force seized Crown
Point, and a few days later Arnold sailed down Lake Champlain
and captured St. John's, which was recovered by the British in
the course of the summer and garrisoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OPINION IN ENGLAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_114" id="TOPIC_114"></a>In England the news of the fighting at Lexington and
Concord was received with astonishment. People were by no
means distressed, for they believed that Gage would soon take
his revenge. Military men were puzzled and provoked at the
state of affairs at Boston. "How often," said a general at the
war office to one who had held command in America, "have I
heard you American colonels boast that with four battalions you
would march through America, and now you think that Gage
with 4,000 men and forty pieces of cannon mayn't venture out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of Boston."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> However, things would, it was expected, soon
wear a different face, for about 5,500 men were on their way to
Boston, and three new generals had embarked on April 21 to
serve under Gage. They were Howe, a younger brother of
Lord Howe, the admiral, a fine gentleman and a gallant soldier,
reputed to be a left-handed cousin of the king through his
mother, a daughter of the Countess of Darlington, a mistress of
George I., kindly, careless, and frivolous, who had distinguished
himself at the taking of Quebec; Clinton, who had served in
Germany; and Burgoyne, who had made a successful campaign
in Portugal under Lippe B&uuml;ckeburg, a man of fashion, a dramatist,
a politician, and a keen soldier, eager for employment and
promotion. North and Dartmouth were vexed at the news
of the encounter, for they had entertained strong hopes, expressed
by the king in closing parliament on May 26, that the
conciliation bill would lead to a pacification. Gage's attempt
at Concord was, Dartmouth said, fatal.</p>

<p>The whigs were dismayed, for they did not share the confidence
of the nation at large. Though Burke expected that the
Americans would suffer "some heavy blows," he did not believe
that a war with them would be ended quickly; and Richmond
thought it probable that America would be lost and "with it our
trade and opulence".<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In England every war gives an opportunity
to some vain and foolish persons for condemning their own
country and showing sympathy with its enemies. So it was in
1775. Wilkes, then lord mayor, and the livery of the city tried
to force the king to receive on the throne a petition which declared
that an attempt was being made to establish arbitrary power in
America. They were foiled by the king and adopted an address
expressed in more decent terms, to which he returned answer
that so long as constitutional authority was resisted he would
continue to maintain it by force. The constitutional society, of
which Horne was the leading spirit, sent Franklin &pound;100 for, as
Horne wrote in the <i>Evening Post</i>, "the widows and orphans of
our beloved American fellow-subjects inhumanly murdered by
the king's troops at or near Lexington and Concord". Horne
was indicted for this libel in 1777, and was sentenced to a year's
imprisonment and a fine of &pound;200.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_115" id="TOPIC_115"></a>In America the news of the affair at Lexington called forth
in every colony a spirit of union, a determination to stand by
their New England brethren. No answers were sent to North's
conciliatory proposals; all alike agreed in referring them to the
continental congress. This was equivalent to a rejection of them,
for it was well known that the British government would hold no
communication with that body. The congress met for the second
time at Philadelphia on May 10. It rejected North's proposals
and agreed that garrisons should be maintained at Ticonderoga
and Crown Point, a decision which implied an approval of the
offensive war levied against the king in the expedition against
those forts. As, however, it was expedient to lull the suspicions
of the French Canadians, who were not likely to have forgotten
the religious bitterness exhibited by the Americans with reference
to the Quebec act, it declared that no invasion of Canada would
be made. The congress assumed executive powers; in the name
of the "United Colonies" it adopted the army of New England
then before Boston as the continental army, took measures for
its organisation and payment, authorised a loan, and on June 15
chose George Washington, the colonel of the Virginia militia, as
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>No wiser choice could have been made. Washington was a
gentleman of Virginia, of independent fortune, descended from
an English family of good position; he had served with distinction
against the French, and as aide-de-camp to Braddock
had behaved with remarkable intrepidity in the battle on the
Monongahela river in 1755. Thoroughly unselfish, he devoted
himself with all his heart to public duty; his integrity was above
suspicion; he was free from personal ambition, and was never
swayed by jealousy. His education had been neglected, but his
intellect was clear and his judgment sound. He was naturally
hot-tempered, and when his anger was roused he was a terror
to evil-doers, to the officer who disobeyed his orders and to the
rascally contractor who supplied his army with inferior stores.
Yet he habitually kept his temper under control. Steadfast in
purpose, he was never overwhelmed by misfortune and never
yielded to factious opposition. And strong as his will was, it
did not degenerate into obstinacy; he would gladly listen to
the advice of others, and in military matters was sometimes
too ready to act upon it. At first he made mistakes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
generalship, but his military skill grew with his experience. In
army administration he was excellent; his industry was unwearying;
the smallest details received his personal attention.
He was conscious of the difficulties of the task which lay before
him; he believed, so he told Patrick Henry, that from the day
of his appointment his reputation would begin to decline. The
congress was an unorganised body without any constitutional
status, conducting its business by means of constantly changing
and irresponsible committees, and was utterly unfit to exercise
executive functions; it had no means of enforcing its decrees, no
revenue, and no munitions of war. The army which it adopted
was little better than an assembly of armed men; many were
volunteers, and it was decided to enlist men only for seven
months. There was little discipline; the officers were for the
most part ignorant of their duties and were of the same social
standing as their men; and the New England privates, self-opiniated
and obstinate, showed little respect for their orders.
Washington had not merely to command an army in the field, he
had to create one and, what was harder still, to keep it together.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SIEGE OF BOSTON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_116" id="TOPIC_116"></a>Inside Boston life was by no means pleasant. All marketing
from the country was at an end, for the town was closely beset
by land and the islands were cleared of provisions; no fresh
meat was to be had, and the besieged lived alternately on salt
beef and salt pork. Attacks from fire-rafts and whale-boats
were daily threatened, and fears were entertained that the inhabitants
might set fire to the town in order to force the British
to leave it.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> On May 25 the three new generals landed, and
the arrival of the reinforcements raised the number of Gage's
army to about 10,000 men. Believing that the rebellion would
soon be quelled, he issued a foolish proclamation, offering pardon
to all rebels who laid down their arms, except Samuel Adams
and Hancock, then president of the congress, and threatening
those who continued in arms with punishment as traitors. As
the insurgents had no ships, while the British had floating
batteries and ships of war in the harbour, they could not hope
to destroy Gage's army, or reduce it to surrender through famine.
Their object was to compel him to evacuate the place and sail
off. The peninsula on which the town stands was commanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
by hills both on the north and south-east. On the north were
the hills of the Charlestown peninsula, which was separated from
Boston by the Charles river; it had the Mystic river on its
northern side, and was joined to the mainland by a narrow neck.
On the south-east it was commanded by the hills of another
peninsula called Dorchester Neck. A battery on either the
Charlestown hills or the Dorchester heights would have rendered
Gage's position untenable; for, independently of any loss which
his troops might sustain from bombardment, the British shipping
would be drawn from its anchorage, and if he remained he
would be practically imprisoned in the town and cut off from
supplies. It should therefore have been Gage's first care to shut
the insurgents out from those positions.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had not attempted to occupy the hills on either
side, but after the arrival of the new generals it was decided
to include them within the lines. On June 13 the insurgents
heard that the British were about to occupy Dorchester heights.
They determined to frustrate this move by occupying the ridge
stretching along the Charlestown peninsula, and called by the
general name of Bunker hill. Accordingly on the evening of
the 16th a detachment of 1,200 men, with six field-pieces, was
sent from Cambridge for that purpose. When they arrived at
the summit their leaders determined to advance farther and to
fortify a lower eminence of the ridge nearer Boston, which was
distinguished by the name of Breeds hill. There during the
night they formed a redoubt and breastwork. At daybreak
on the 17th they were discovered from the sloop <i>Lively</i>, and
her guns roused the British army. Before long a battery in
Boston and the guns of other ships opened fire, but did little
mischief. The insurgents received a small reinforcement, and
formed a line of defence, protected by a low wall and rail, from
their redoubt northward to the Mystic, in order to secure themselves
from a flank attack. If Gage had placed a floating battery
on the Mystic, which would have taken them on the left flank,
and had landed troops to the rear of the redoubt, held the
neck, and so cut them off from their main body, he would
have had them at his mercy. This would have been easy, for
by taking up a more advanced position than was laid down in
their orders, they left their rear exposed to attack. He decided,
however, to storm their works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.</i></div>

<p>Not till midday did a detachment of British troops, grenadiers
and light infantry, begin to land on the peninsula under
the command of Howe and Pigot. They waited for reinforcements,
which brought their number up to over 2,000 men,
with artillery. Hot as the weather was, the men were burdened
with knapsacks containing provisions for three days. At 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
they advanced in two divisions, the light infantry under Howe
against the line of defence, the grenadiers under Pigot against the
redoubt. At first their advance was covered by their artillery,
but the guns stuck in the mire, and it is said that a fresh supply
of ball sent from Boston was too large for the cannon. Even
if this was the case, it could have made no difference, for
the supply taken with the guns was not exhausted.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Up the
steep hill, through long tangled grass, the red-coats toiled on
towards the redoubt, each burdened with a weight of some 125
pounds. With admirable coolness the Americans held their fire
until the enemy was about fifty yards from them, and then
poured a volley into their ranks. For a few minutes the men
stood steady and returned the fire, then they turned and retreated
in disorder. The attack on the fence was equally unsuccessful.
While the officers were rallying their men, the battery on Cops
hill burnt the wooden houses of the almost deserted village of
Charlestown, from which the troops had been fired upon as they
advanced. Then a second attack was made, and again the
British were sent staggering back by the enemy's fire. At this
crisis Clinton came over from Boston, took command of two
battalions, a body of marines, and the 47th, and did good service
in helping to rally the troops. With fine persistency they
made ready for a third attack. More rational orders were given;
the force was not divided, and only a feint was made against
the line of defence, the men laid aside their knapsacks, advanced
in column against the redoubt, and attacked with the bayonet.
The Americans, who had received little support of any kind
from headquarters, were weary, and their ammunition was almost
exhausted; they were driven from their works and retreated
across the neck. Their retreat was covered with bravery and
military skill<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> by the body stationed along the line of defence on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
their left, but as they passed over the neck they suffered severely
from the guns of the <i>Glasgow</i> sloop of war. Howe would not
pursue them, and at once began to fortify the peninsula.</p>

<p>The victory was decisive, for it gave the English the ground
for which they fought, and enabled them to hold Boston for
nine months longer. It was dearly purchased by the loss of
19 officers and 207 men killed, and 70 officers and 758 men
wounded, making a total of 1,054 casualties, an extraordinarily
large proportion of the number engaged, apparently about
2,500. This was the natural result of sending troops up a hill
to deliver a frontal attack on an earthwork held by a body of
men well used to shoot. It will be observed that the loss of
officers was extremely heavy; they fearlessly exposed themselves,
as the British officer always does, in order to encourage
their men. The Americans, who for the most part fought behind
cover, stated their loss at 449. After Bunker hill, no one whose
judgment was not warped by prejudice could believe that the
Americans were cowards. They were not, so Gage wrote, the
disorderly rabble too many have supposed; he had seen enough
to convince him that the conquest of the country could only be
effected by perseverance and strong armies.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The behaviour of
the insurgent troops greatly encouraged their party. When
Washington heard how they had fought he declared that the
liberties of the country were safe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INVASION OF CANADA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_117" id="TOPIC_117"></a>Already some colonies were making temporary arrangements
for popular government and issuing bills for the expenses of
defence, and in July Georgia expressed its adherence to the
general policy of armed resistance. For a while, however,
royal governors still remained, and government was everywhere
in a chaotic state. In New York the mob committed many
outrages on the persons and property of loyalists, and hostilities
took place with crews of the king's ships in the bay. Yet the
town was not prepared to take a decided part; and it received
Tryon, the royal governor, and Washington with the same
tokens of respect. A like incongruity marked the proceedings
of congress. Besides adopting addresses to the people of Great
Britain and Ireland, it sent a petition to the king on whom it
was levying war from his "faithful subjects," expressing attach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ment
to his "person, family, and government" and beseeching
him to "settle peace". At the same time, in spite of its declaration
to the contrary, it ordered an invasion of Canada. The
Americans flattered themselves that the Canadians would rise
against the British, and Allen, puffed up by his recent success,
made a dash at Montreal with only 150 men. He was defeated
and taken prisoner. Meanwhile Montgomery started from Ticonderoga
in August with over 2,000 men, captured Chambl&eacute;e,
where he found a good supply of military stores, and laid siege
to St. John's. Canada was practically defenceless, for Carleton
had only 900 regular troops; the English-speaking Canadians
were disaffected, the French for the most part either apathetic
or hostile. He sent to Gage for reinforcements, but the admiral,
Samuel Graves, declined to transport troops to Quebec, for as it
was then late in October the voyage from Boston would have
been dangerous. Carleton's efforts to relieve St. John's were unsuccessful,
and after a stout resistance the garrison surrendered
on November 13. The fall of St. John's involved the surrender
of Montreal, which was defenceless, and Carleton hastened to the
defence of Quebec.</p>

<p>His presence was needed there, for on September 13 a
detachment of about 1,500 men under the command of Arnold
was sent from the army at Cambridge to surprise and capture
the city. It was to proceed by land and water up the Kennebec,
and down the Chaudi&egrave;re to the St. Lawrence. The route,
though used by trappers and Indians, was dimly traced, and
the equipment of the expedition was too cumbersome for the
rough work which lay before it.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Soon after leaving their
transports at Fort Western, where, fifty-eight miles from its
mouth, the Kennebec ceased to be navigable except by <i>bateaux</i>,
the troops began to suffer great hardships. Their stores were
conveyed in <i>bateaux</i>, which they were constantly forced to haul
against currents and carry over land. Many of them leaked,
some were abandoned, and provisions ran short. The weather
became cold and rainy. The whole rear division, with its
officers, lost heart and turned back, taking with them a large
share of food and ammunition. The rest toiled on through
swamps and mire, half-starved and benumbed with cold. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
perished, some lost their way, and the men of one company were
reduced to eating their dogs and gnawing the leather of their
shoes. It was not until November 9 that Arnold's troops, a
ragged and shivering crowd of about 600 men, with some
Indians who had joined them, reached Point Levi. Montgomery,
who was to have met them, was not there; they crossed the St.
Lawrence, and Arnold sent an absurd summons to the garrison
of Quebec. He then retreated to Pointe-aux-Trembles to wait
for Montgomery.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_118" id="TOPIC_118"></a>The defences of Quebec were in bad condition, the garrison
was small, and there was much disaffection among the inhabitants.
The whole country was in the power of the invaders, the
people were on their side, and it seemed as though the hopes of
the Americans would be fulfilled. But while Quebec remained
untaken, Canada would still be unconquered, and the defence
was in good hands. The garrison was commanded by Colonel
Maclean of the 84th, or Royal Highland Emigrants, a regiment
largely raised by him from Frazer's Highlanders who had done
good service under Wolfe. Carleton soon entered the place,
and while Arnold was waiting for Montgomery, took vigorous
measures for securing its safety. Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles
on December 1, and on the night of the 31st the
rebels attempted to carry Quebec by storm. They were repulsed
with heavy loss, Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded.
They continued the siege, but were too weak either to invest
the city completely or make any offensive movement. Carleton
waited quietly until the breaking up of the ice should allow
reinforcements to come up the river. Before long the French
Canadians began to transfer their sympathies to the British.
Their priests were too well satisfied with the Quebec act to desire
change. Bishop Briand published a <i>mandement</i>, reminding his
people of the benefits they received from English rule and
calling upon them to defend their province. His exhortation
had a powerful effect, for priests refused to confess men who
joined the rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PAUCITY OF THE BRITISH ARMY.</i></div>

<p>The victory of Bunker hill made no change in the position
of Gage's army, which suffered from the want of wholesome
food and from other privations. As England had command of
the sea the troops could have been removed, and the generals
wrote to the government suggesting that Boston should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
evacuated and the royal forces concentrated at New York, which
was more open to communication by sea, and in every respect
a better base for future operations. The government, however,
was unwilling to give up the town, and things remained as they
were, for the generals considered that nothing was to be gained
by an attack on the enemy's lines, because their army was not
supplied with the materials necessary to move at a distance.
Plans were indeed proposed for embarrassing the enemy by
sending out a detachment to make a descent on Rhode Island;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
but Gage did nothing, and the government, convinced of his
incapacity, recalled him to England. He sailed from Boston in
October, and Howe was appointed to the chief command. By
sea there was as little done as by land, for the naval force under
Graves was so inefficient that he was unable even to prevent the
whale-boats of the rebels from intercepting supplies and destroying
lighthouses. He was unjustly blamed for inaction, both by
the army in Boston and the government. His removal was, the
king thought, "as necessary as the mild general's".<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> This and
every other matter connected with the war was directed by the
king. His industry and his knowledge of details, military and
naval, were extraordinary, and North, Dartmouth, and Barrington,
whatever their own opinions were, had no choice but to
carry out his orders.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_119" id="TOPIC_119"></a>On the outbreak of the war the army of Great Britain was
on its normal peace establishment of about 17,000 men, besides
the Irish army of 15,235, the garrison of Gibraltar 3,500, and of
Minorca 2,500. It was an amazingly small number, considering
the accessions made to the empire by the late war. George
always wished for a larger permanent force; but his ministers
shrank from raising a storm by increasing the estimates or
provoking the popular jealousy of a standing army. Men were
wanted at once. The first reinforcements were obtained from
Ireland, and the Irish parliament agreed that 4,000 men should
be drafted out of the country beyond the number allowed by
statute. It soon became evident that the war required the
immediate supply of a far greater number of men than could
be spared from the present establishment or could be raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
quickly. Parliament was not in session, and the king determined
to obtain the services of foreign troops. As Elector
of Hanover he lent 2,355 Hanoverians to garrison Gibraltar
and Minorca, and so set a corresponding number of the British
garrisons free to be employed in the war. He sought to hire
men from other sovereigns. A proposal made to Catherine of
Russia for the hire of 20,000 men was scornfully declined, and
the States-General refused to sell him their Scots brigade. With
the petty princes of Germany he was more lucky; the Duke of
Brunswick, the Landgrave and the hereditary Prince of Hesse
Cassel, and the Prince of Waldeck were happy to sell their
subjects, and agreed to supply 17,742 in return for a liberal
payment. These arrangements enraged the Americans, who
spoke of them as though the king was delivering a loyal people
to be massacred by foreign mercenaries. As a matter of fact
they were making war on the king, and he had as good a right
to buy troops to fight in his quarrel as he had to buy cannon.
It is on the princes who sold the blood of their subjects that
the disgrace of these transactions must rest. Frederick of Prussia
expressed his disgust at their greediness in bitter terms, and is
said to have jeeringly declared that when any of the unfortunate
men whose lives they were selling passed through his dominions
he would levy toll on them at so much a head as though they
were cattle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EVACUATION OF BOSTON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_120" id="TOPIC_120"></a>Nothing was gained by the recall of Gage, for Howe was
equally incompetent. Privateers were fitted out in great number
in the New England ports, which did mischief to English commerce
and intercepted the supplies sent out to the army. In
order to check this privateering business two ships-of-war sailed
from Boston in October, under a lieutenant named Mowat, with
orders to burn the shipping along the coast. Mowat exceeded
his orders and destroyed the town of Falmouth. This useless
act of barbarity, which excited violent indignation among the
Americans, was reprehended by the British government. In
Boston sickness continued rife among the troops, and in November
there was an outbreak of small-pox. Washington, however,
was not in a position to attack; he had great difficulty
in obtaining ammunition and not less in raising men. The
revolutionary spirit was spreading, but there was little military
ardour. In December the period of enlistment ended; his army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
was disbanded, and he could not obtain quite 10,000 men to
take its place. Though Howe's army was weakened by sickness,
such effective troops as he had were well-trained soldiers. Yet
he made no attempt to force the American lines. By the
beginning of March Washington was able to take the offensive,
and on the night of the 4th occupied Dorchester heights and
began to plant cannon there. It is amazing that Howe should
have neglected this important position. A storm prevented him
from sending a force across the bay to attack the Americans'
works before they were completed; their batteries rendered
Boston untenable and endangered the ships in the harbour.
Howe was forced to abandon the town, and on the 17th the
British troops, about 7,600 in number, together with nearly
1,000 loyalists, embarked for Halifax, where Howe waited for
reinforcements which would enable him to strike at New York.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_121" id="TOPIC_121"></a>If the English had abandoned Boston after the battle of
Bunker hill, the evacuation would have merely been a military
movement, adopted for the purpose of obtaining a more convenient
base for future operations. The government decided
that the place should be held, and its enforced evacuation was a
moral defeat and a legitimate cause of triumph to the Americans.
Their exultation was dashed by the failure of their attempt on
Canada. Fresh troops were sent to support the invasion, but
the feelings of the people, English as well as French, were
turning strongly against the Americans. After the evacuation
of Boston, congress ordered Washington to send nearly half
his effective force into Canada, and despatched Franklin and
other commissioners thither to allure the people with promises.
The Canadians turned a deaf ear to their offers. The moment
for which Carleton waited so patiently came at last. On May
6, before the river was fully cleared of ice, three British ships
made their way to Quebec with reinforcements. He at once
sallied out, and the Americans fled in confusion, leaving their
cannon and baggage behind, and even their pots boiling, so that
the king's troops sat down and ate their dinners from them.
Further reinforcements arrived from Halifax and from Ireland,
and in June Burgoyne, who had spent the winter at home,
brought over the Hessian and Brunswick troops, raising Carleton's
army to about 12,000 men. The Americans, under
Sullivan, retreated from the neighbourhood of Quebec to Sorel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
A large detachment was routed at Three Rivers, and Sullivan
retreated to St. John's, leisurely pursued by Burgoyne. There
he was joined by Arnold, and the remnants of the army of
Canada, some 5,000 men, suffering severely from sickness and
privation, escaped to Isle-aux-Noix, and thence to Crown Point.
Canada was evacuated in June. Left almost defenceless by
England, it was preserved to her by Carleton's firmness and
intrepidity.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_122" id="TOPIC_122"></a>By the beginning of 1776 the idea of separation from Great
Britain was daily gaining ground in the revolted colonies. It was
strengthened by the publication of a pamphlet entitled <i>Common
Sense</i> by Thomas Paine. This Paine, a staymaker by trade, after
he had failed in business in England, and had been dismissed
from employment as an exciseman for neglect of duty, emigrated
to America in 1774, and came into notice through introductions
given him by Franklin. He was bitterly hostile to his
own country, a violent advocate of revolutionary ideas, ignorant
and conceited; yet he had much shrewdness, and expressed his
rude opinions with a force and vivacity which appealed strongly
to readers prepared to assent to them. <i>Common Sense</i> taught
thousands of Americans to recognise for the first time their own
thoughts and wishes, and encouraged others, who already knew
what they wanted, to cease from disguising their hopes by
empty professions. Separation would, it was expected in England,
be opposed most vigorously in the southern colonies. In
them its cause was forwarded by violence. Lord Dunmore, the
governor of Virginia, took refuge on board a man-of-war in
June, 1775, manned a small flotilla, and attempted to reduce his
province by making descents upon the coast. He enraged the
people by offering freedom to slaves who would enlist under
him, and by destroying the town of Norfolk through setting
fire to some wharfs from which his men had been shot at
while landing for water. He further engaged in a scheme
for invading the southern colonies from inland with the help
of the Indians. It failed, and the result of his proceedings was
that Virginia was foremost in urging congress to a declaration
of independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ATTEMPT ON CHARLESTON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_123" id="TOPIC_123"></a>The governors of the two Carolinas assured the king that
if a force were sent to their provinces the loyalists would rise;
the Carolinas might be secured, Virginia coerced, and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
south recovered for the crown. Both George and Dartmouth
believed them, and, against the advice of military men, an expedition
was prepared to sail to Cape Fear. The troops were
conveyed in a squadron under Sir Peter Parker and were under
the command of Lord Cornwallis. Clinton left Boston in December
to take the command, but the expedition was long
a-preparing: it did not leave Cork until February 12, 1776; the
ships met with storms; none arrived at Cape Fear before May
3, some were even later. Meanwhile Martin, the governor of
North Carolina, stirred up the loyalist Scots settled in the province
to take arms; they marched towards the coast, expecting
to meet the royal troops, were intercepted, and utterly routed.
When at last Clinton's force was gathered together, his time
for action was short, for he was under orders to meet Howe
at New York at an early date. He and Parker decided to
make an attempt on the harbour of Charleston, the chief town
of South Carolina, for the trade carried on there was an important
source of the insurgents' funds. It was not until June
4 that the British force, about 2,000 troops, with Parker's
squadron arrived at Charleston harbour.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_124" id="TOPIC_124"></a>The entrance was commanded by Sullivan's island and there
the insurgents under Moultrie had erected a fort and mounted
guns. Clinton landed his troops on Long island, intending that
at low tide they should wade across to Sullivan's island and
attack the garrison on their rear, while the ships bombarded
them in front. The attempt was made on the 28th. The tide
did not run out sufficiently to allow the troops to ford the shoals
and the engagement was simply an artillery duel. The British
ships suffered severely; one frigate which went aground was set
on fire to prevent the enemy from taking it, Parker's flagship
the <i>Bristol</i> and the <i>Experiment</i>, both of fifty guns, were much
knocked about, and some 200 men were killed or wounded.
The attack failed, and on July 21 Clinton's force sailed for New
York under convoy of a single frigate, the rest of Parker's ships
being forced to refit. The expedition strengthened the party of
separation and bound the south closely together. Its failure
depressed the loyalists, and for three years freed the southern
colonies from invasion, and enabled them to send help to other
quarters. Less than a week after the unsuccessful attempt on
Charleston, on July 4, the congress at Philadelphia, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
all the thirteen colonies were represented, put forth a declaration
of independence; the colonies renounced their allegiance,
and declared themselves free and independent states, the United
States of America.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_125" id="TOPIC_125"></a>The progress of the revolt during the summer of 1775
strengthened the king's determination to subdue it by force.
A proclamation was issued in August against traitorous correspondence
with the Americans, and in September Penn, who
brought over the petition of congress to the king, was informed
that no answer would be made to it. George could not have
received it without recognising congress, an unauthorised assemblage
of his subjects engaged in levying war against him.
The government was powerful in parliament, and the great
majority of the nation warmly approved the royal policy, of
which the ministers were scarcely more than the agents. Little
doubt was felt as to the successful issue of the war; public spirit
was aroused, and the cause of England was generally held to be
just. The landed gentry and the professions of the Church, the
army, and the law were strongly on the king's side. Self-interest
largely decided the attitude of the mercantile class: some of its
members were opposed to the war because it injured their trade;
others were in favour of it; for trade generally was brisk and was
increased by the demands brought by war. In London and
Bristol the opposition had many supporters, but in both cities
there was a strong party in favour of the government. Among
the labouring classes the war was not popular and recruiting
was difficult, for service in America entailed a long voyage full
of discomfort, and the prospect of fighting with men of the
same race and language was repellent. The evangelicals and
methodists sided with the government; the dissenters generally
were against the war and their preachers were active in encouraging
their dislike to it. Addresses approving of the king's policy
were numerous and unsolicited; they poured in from all quarters,
from tory Oxford and whiggish Cambridge, from country
towns and great commercial centres like Liverpool and Manchester.
Rockingham observed that violent measures were
countenanced by a majority of persons "of all ranks, professions,
or occupations in this country". Scotland almost to a man was
of the same persuasion. In Ireland the nobles and the gentry
generally upheld the court, but with the majority of protestants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and specially with the presbyterians of the north, the war was
highly unpopular.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHANGES IN THE MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_126" id="TOPIC_126"></a>The opponents of the government were not less resolute than
the king. Lord Effingham resigned his commission in the army
lest he should be called upon to serve against the Americans,
and Chatham's eldest son took the same course in obedience to
the wishes of his parents. Grafton wrote to North in August,
1775, expressing his desire for conciliation. On October 20
North sent him a draft of the king's speech which showed him
that the government was determined to reduce the rebellion
by force of arms. He resigned the privy seal and went into
opposition. The changes which followed proved that a vigorous
policy would be carried out. Dartmouth took Grafton's place
and was succeeded as secretary of state for the colonies by Lord
George Germain, previously known as Lord George Sackville.
Germain was at this time one of North's followers, and was
appointed in order that he might help him in the commons.
Violent in his feelings against the Americans, he was acceptable
to the king and acquired influence over him. His appointment
was unpopular. He had fair ability, but as minister allowed
himself to be swayed by personal motives, and he pursued a
system already adopted by the king of directing military operations
in America from London which had disastrous consequences.
Rochford retired with a pension of &pound;2,500 and was succeeded by
Weymouth as secretary of the southern department.</p>

<p>The king's speech at the opening of parliament on October
26, 1775, stated that the Americans were in rebellion and were
seeking to "establish an independent empire". Eight months
had yet to pass before the colonies declared their independence,
and the effect of events which hastened their decision, such as
the employment of German troops and the refusal to answer the
petition of congress, was not yet known in England. It will,
however, scarcely be denied that between the proceedings of
congress and a formal declaration of independence the distance
was not great. The strength of the king's position lay in his
recognition of this fact and of the course which alone might have
quelled the growing spirit of rebellion without humiliation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Great Britain. The opposition did not see facts as they really
were, and called for remedies which were either vague, of various
import, insufficient, or such as would have placed the crown in
a humiliating position. In the lords' debate on the address,
Rockingham urged a vague undertaking to adopt measures of
conciliation, Grafton the repeal of the acts relating to America
since 1763, and Shelburne that the petition of congress proved
that the colonies were not "planning independence". In the
commons Burke taunted the ministers with failure; and Fox,
who was coming to the front, praised the spirit of the Americans,
denied that they were aiming at independence, and bitterly attacked
North, who, said he, had lost more in one campaign than
Chatham, Frederick of Prussia, or Alexander the Great had ever
gained&mdash;he had lost a whole continent. The address was carried
in the lords by 76 to 33, and in the commons by 176 to 72.</p>

<p>Motions were made in both houses declaring that the employment
of Hanoverian troops within the king's dominions, at
Gibraltar and Minorca, without previous consent of parliament
was unconstitutional. It was, the opposition maintained, a violation
of the bill of rights, which declared that "the keeping a
standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be
with consent of parliament, is against law". On the government
side it was pointed out that it was not a time of peace and that
the clause did not apply to the dependencies of the kingdom.
North, however, consented to a bill of indemnity which was
thrown out by the lords, the opposition objecting to it on the
ground that it asserted the legality of the measure, the government
that it was totally unnecessary. Numerically weak as the
opposition was, it maintained the fight with spirit. Motions
more or less directly aimed at the war policy of the government
were made in the lords by Grafton and Richmond, and in the
commons by Luttrell, Fox, Burke, Oliver, Hartley, Lowther, and
Sawbridge. On none of these did the minority vote stronger
than 33 in the lords and 105 in the commons. Burke, in
bringing in a bill on November 16 for composing the troubles
in America, urged that the right way was by concessions to be
followed by treaty. He would maintain the declaratory act of
1766 as necessary to the authority of parliament, and certain acts
passed since 1763 as necessary to British trade; and he desired
that parliament should enact that no tax should be levied on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
colonies other than by their voluntary grant, and should repeal
coercive acts such as that closing Boston harbour. These concessions,
while greater than the government would make, would
not, it was pointed out, have satisfied the Americans; they did not
go to the root of American discontent, which lay in the revenue
laws, and dated not from the year 1766, but reached back to
1672. After a long debate, of which we have virtually no record,
for strangers were excluded from the house, the bill was lost by
210 votes to 105.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STATE OF THE NAVY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_127" id="TOPIC_127"></a>The government was successful in its proposals for the maintenance
of the war. Only 15,230 seamen were in pay in 1775;
for 1776 the number voted was 28,000. In the debate serious
charges were brought against the administration of the navy.
Sandwich was diligent; he constantly inspected the dockyards,
an excellent custom which he instituted when first lord in 1749,
and he kept the navy board to its duties.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> At his office early in
the morning he got through an amount of work surprising in the
case of a man who habitually spent the later part of his day and
his nights in drinking, gambling, and debauchery. The effect
of his diligence was spoilt by corrupt practices. Many abuses
prevailed in the administration of the navy before his time;
money voted for repairs was applied to other purposes, stores
were paid for which were used for private gain, sea-pay was
drawn for men who existed only on paper. Under Sandwich
abuses of all kinds seem to have been carried further than before.
The navy in 1776 consisted of 317 ships of various sizes and
49 sloops.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Of these 123 ships were "of the line of battle," a
term then generally restricted to the first three rates, ships of
sixty-four guns and upwards. In spite of the large sums voted
for repairs, many of the king's ships were utterly unseaworthy,
and it was alleged with truth that ships, perfectly capable of
repair, were sold as useless, while others, for which much money
had been voted, had not had a penny spent upon them. On
this matter more must be said later.</p>

<p>A bill enabling the king to embody the militia in times of
rebellion met with strong opposition on the ground that it would
place a dangerous power in the hands of the crown, and was subversive
of the constitutional idea of the militia as a purely local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
force to be used only for domestic defence; it was, however,
finally carried by large majorities. On the other hand, North's
proposal to extend the militia to Scotland was defeated by 112
to 95, for the country gentlemen, who regarded the militia system
with extreme jealousy, voted against it. For the army a
vote was obtained for 55,000 men, of which 25,000 were to be
employed in America. It was easier to vote the money than to
find the men. The difficulty of recruiting was alleged by government
to be a result of the briskness of trade and such like causes.
Already the Irish army was reduced by drafts to less than the
12,000 men that by statute were to be kept in that kingdom,
and the government excited the indignation of an independent
section in the Irish parliament and of the protestants of Ulster
by obtaining leave to withdraw 4,000 men more. The conduct
of the government in this matter and in that of the hiring of
German troops was strenuously though ineffectually attacked in
the British parliament. The supplies voted for the year 1776
amounted to &pound;9,097,000. The land tax was raised to four
shillings in the pound, and that with other ordinary ways and
means would, North calculated, bring in &pound;7,143,000. He proposed
to make up the deficiency by borrowing &pound;2,000,000; the
loan was to be funded, and the interest of the new stock was
provided for by new taxes on carriages and stage coaches, dice
and cards, by an additional stamp duty, and by raising the penny
stamp on newspapers to three-halfpence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COMMISSIONERS FOR PACIFICATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_128" id="TOPIC_128"></a>Acting on the ground taken up by the king's speech that the
colonies were waging a rebellious war, North, on November 20,
1775, brought in a "prohibitory" bill, which forbade all trade
and intercourse with the Americans, provided that American
ships and goods taken at sea should be forfeited to the captors,
being officers and crews of the king's ships, and repealed certain
acts as no longer appropriate in the present state of war. It
also empowered the crown to appoint commissioners to inquire
into grievances, to grant pardons to individuals, and to receive
into the king's peace any districts or colonies which would
return to obedience. North declared himself ready to repeal
the tea duty and to suspend all exercise of the right of taxation
if the Americans would bear their share of the burden of
national defence. The bill was carried after violent opposition
in both houses. Fox described the war as unjust and impractic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>able,
and said that the bill exhibited the folly of the ministers.
It was, the opposition urged, cruel and indiscriminate in its
scope; it excited our seamen to "promiscuous rapine," and
provided that American sailors who were taken prisoners might
be compelled to serve in the British navy against their own
people. Such severity, they said, would drive the Americans
to a permanent separation and would eventually land us in a
war with European powers. On the other hand it was reasonably
maintained that, as the Americans were already at war with
us, the war must be carried on as if against alien enemies. In
April, 1776, the king appointed Admiral Richard Lord Howe,
then about to take the command in American waters, and his
brother, General Howe, as commissioners in pursuance of the
act. Their appointment testifies to the sincerity of the king's
desire for peace, for the Howes were friendly to the Americans
and had already made efforts to bring the quarrel to a peaceful
ending; the admiral, indeed, declared in the lords that if he were
ordered to take part in the war, it would be painful to him as a
man, though he should obey as an officer. George, however,
was determined not to sacrifice any of the rights of his crown.
Submission would be rewarded with pardon, obstinacy in rebellion
met by war. He feared lest Lord Howe should concede
too much, and wished that he would decline the commission.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
He did not decline, and sailed for America with offers of pardon.
The king's speech at the close of the session on May 23
expressed the earnest hope that his rebellious subjects would
"voluntarily return to their duty". Peace was only to be obtained
by obedience.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_129" id="TOPIC_129"></a>On June 11, 1776, Howe sailed from Halifax with his army
of 9,000 men, and on July 3 occupied Staten Island without
opposition. There he was joined by the reinforcements from
England, conveyed by Lord Howe, and by Clinton and his
troops, so that in August he had with him some 25,000
men, English and German. Washington's army at New York
numbered about 19,000 effectives.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Mindful of his commission
to restore tranquillity, Lord Howe wrote to him enclosing a copy
of the king's offers. Washington would not receive the letter
because the address did not acknowledge his military rank, and
observed that the powers of the commissioners extended only
to granting pardons, and that his people had done nothing for
which they needed pardon. The pacific mission of the Howes
having so far failed, the general on August 22-25 landed an
army on Long Island, which is separated from New York by
the East river. Brooklyn heights on Long Island, opposite
New York, were strongly fortified and held by the Americans.
Washington, believing that a larger British force was left in
Staten Island than was really the case, thought it necessary to
keep a numerous garrison in New York to meet a direct attack
on the place, and detached only some 9,000 men under Putnam
to Long Island. They were for the most part posted so as
to hold a belt of wooded hills lying between their lines and
the royal army. During the night of the 26th Howe outflanked
them and brought his main body to a position on their rear.
The next day an attack was made on their front; they were
caught between two divisions of the king's troops and were defeated.
Howe put their loss at 3,300, which is certainly an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
overestimate, though he made nearly 1,100 prisoners, among
them the generals Sullivan and Lord Stirling, as the Americans
called him, an unsuccessful claimant of that earldom.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
British casualties were 377. The Americans retreated within
their inner lines. If Howe had allowed his troops to storm their
entrenchments he would probably have destroyed or taken the
whole force on the island. He considered, however, that the
lines could in a few days be taken "at a very cheap rate" by
regular approaches, and decided not to risk the loss of any
more men.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> He let his opportunity slip, and on the night
of the 29th Washington, helped by a fog, cleverly withdrew
his troops across the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW YORK TAKEN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_130" id="TOPIC_130"></a>Lord Howe took advantage of the American defeat to invite
congress to send some of its members to confer with him unofficially
as to possible terms of peace. Congress, though it refused
to sanction any unofficial negotiations, sent commissioners
from its own body to confer with him. Nothing came of the
conference, for the American commissioners would not treat
except on the basis of independence. On September 15 the
British army descended on Manhattan Island, on which New
York stands, and the American militia fled in disorder. The
British took possession of New York and of sixty-six of the
enemy's guns. If Howe's movements had been more prompt he
might have cut off a large number of the enemy; he is said to
have wasted time by lingering over luncheon at the house of the
mother of Lindley Murray, the grammar-writer, who detained
him by her crafty hospitality. Washington drew off his troops
to Haarlem heights, in the northern part of the island. The
next day there was some skirmishing in which the Americans
held their ground. The loyalists of New York had been shamefully
treated by the dominant faction, and the British were received
with joy.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> A few days later a large part of the city was
destroyed by fires evidently kindled by incendiaries. Washington
and other generals had wished for military reasons to burn
the place. They were prevented by congress, but the idea was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
taken up by some violent revolutionists. The Americans were
disheartened by their ill-success; Washington's troops deserted
in large numbers, and the greatest disorder prevailed in his
army. In England the news of Howe's victory and his occupation
of New York was received with delight, and the king
rewarded him with the Order of the Bath.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_131" id="TOPIC_131"></a>The acquisition of New York gave the army an excellent
base for operations either in the northern or southern provinces;
it was easily accessible by sea, and lay in the midst of a district
where loyalism was strong. According to the ministerial plan,
Howe should have been joined by Carleton's army, which
was to have taken Crown Point and Ticonderoga, gained possession
of the upper Hudson, and invaded the province of New
York from the north. After the Americans were chased out of
Canada, Carleton's operations were stopped by the lack of a fleet
to wrest the command of Lake Champlain from the rebels.
During the summer he devoted himself with extraordinary
energy to collecting and building vessels. Ships sent out from
England were taken to pieces, carried overland to St. John's and
put together again, little gunboats and transports were built,
and by the beginning of October a larger and better fleet than
that of the Americans was afloat on the lake. It engaged the
enemy's fleet, under Arnold, off Valcour island, on the 11th and
again on the 13th, and utterly destroyed it; only three of their
vessels escaped.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Carleton occupied Crown Point, but as the
season was so far advanced did not attack Ticonderoga, or stay
long enough to put Crown Point in a defensible condition; he
placed his army in winter quarters and returned to Quebec.
He might have done more. His decision disappointed the king,
and was represented to him in an unfavourable light, for Germain
had a personal grudge against Carleton, and had already,
in August, sent an order, which failed to reach him, that beyond
his province the command was to be taken by Burgoyne.
George, conscious of Carleton's signal services, at first declared
himself satisfied that he had good reason for his decision; but
Germain had the royal ear, and when the news came that
Carleton had actually closed the campaign, the king accused
him of slackness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WASHINGTON'S RETREAT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_132" id="TOPIC_132"></a>An example of real slackness was being given by Howe at
New York. He should with the aid of the fleet have made a
prompt effort to prevent Washington from retreating from Manhattan
island, and to cut off his communications with Connecticut
whence he was drawing supplies. Even before occupying
New York he might have conveyed his army by water to a
point from which White Plains, where the land begins to
broaden out rapidly, might have been reached with ease. He
wasted four weeks of precious time at New York, and did not
embark his troops till October 12. Washington left his narrow
position on Haarlem heights, gained White Plains before him,
and fortified his camp. Howe attacked him on the 28th with
the object of outflanking him. Although part of his army by a
frontal attack drove the American right from a strong position,
this success was fruitless as well as costly. The insurgents'
centre was weak, and if he had attacked it in force he might
have crushed them completely. He made no further attempt
in that direction, and Washington retreated to a good position
behind Croton river. Howe returned to New York. There,
however, he dealt the Americans a serious blow. Fort Washington,
on Manhattan island, and Fort Lee, opposite to it on
the Jersey shore, were intended to bar the Hudson and so secure
communications with the country to the west of it. Congress,
which often interfered in military matters, ordered that Fort
Washington should be held, though in fact the forts did not
prevent our ships from passing up the river. On November 16
a well-planned attack was made upon the fort; it was forced to
surrender, and 2,858 prisoners, forty-three cannon, and a large
quantity of small arms were taken by the British.</p>

<p>Two days later Cornwallis took possession of Fort Lee,
together with 140 cannon and stores of various kinds. He
rapidly overran New Jersey. Washington had been drawn
down thither, and Lee, whom he left at the Croton, failed to
support him. He retreated hastily through New Jersey with a
force daily diminished by desertion. Cornwallis pressed upon
him, but was detained by Howe's orders for a week at Brunswick;
and Washington, who left Princeton only an hour before
Cornwallis entered it, had just time to convey his army, then
reduced to some 3,300 men,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> across the Delaware on December 8<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
before the British came up. They were unable to follow him
at once for no boats were left on the eastern bank. Howe, who
had joined Cornwallis, decided that no more could be done and
placed the army in winter quarters. He divided it into small
detachments, and for the sake of protecting and encouraging the
loyalists, extended his line of communication for eighty miles.
The fortunes of the insurgents were at low ebb. Not only were
the loyalists strong in New Jersey, but crowds of the rebel party,
many of them men of high standing, took advantage of the
amnesty which Howe was empowered to offer. The Delaware
would soon be frozen over, and, if the British crossed it, Washington
had not a sufficient force to hinder them from marching
on Philadelphia. The town was panic-stricken, and congress
removed to Baltimore. Washington's army dwindled. The
period for which his regular troops were enlisted would end on
January 1, and as for the militia, that "destructive, expensive,
and disorderly mob" as he called them, they came and went
as they pleased. "The game," he thought, "was pretty well
played out."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The Americans' distress was heightened by the
capture of Lee, who was on his way to join Washington.
They reckoned him their ablest general, though his insubordination
and self-seeking rendered the loss of him an actual
gain. About the same time Clinton sailed to Rhode Island
with Sir Peter Parker, and occupied Newport without opposition.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_133" id="TOPIC_133"></a>Washington's only chance lay in immediate action. The
foolish disposition of the British army gave him an opportunity.
Their central cantonments, nearest to the enemy, were weak.
Trenton was held by only 1,200 Hessians; their discipline
was relaxed, they were hindered by difference of language
from gaining intelligence, and they lived in careless security.
Washington was reinforced by Lee's troops and by three regiments
from Ticonderoga, which Carleton's inaction had rendered
available for service in the south. On the night of December 25
he crossed the Delaware, and before daybreak took Trenton by
surprise. The startled garrison could make no resistance; about
200 escaped and 918 were taken prisoners. Of the Americans
only two were killed and six wounded. Cornwallis, who was
on the point of embarking for England, hastened back to the
Jersey army. Washington avoided a general engagement, de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>feated
two regiments employed in an operation for the defence
of Princeton, and before the middle of January, 1777, compelled
the British by a series of well-conducted movements to evacuate
West Jersey and withdraw to Brunswick and Amboy,
where they went into quarters. The king's troops, British and
German, committed many excesses, plundering friends and
foes alike; and the inhabitants, indignant at their conduct, took
advantage of Washington's success and turned against them.
Many joined Washington's army. The British were in the
midst of a hostile population, and though they had communication
with New York by water, were almost besieged by land, for
their supplies were constantly intercepted. The Jersey loyalists
were left to the vengeance of their neighbours and were mercilessly
plundered. Many of them fled to New York where
several thousand provincial troops were embodied. Howe
remained inactive at New York until the spring, and Washington
also stayed quietly at his headquarters at Morristown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A PARTIAL SECESSION FROM PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_134" id="TOPIC_134"></a>Parliament was opened on October 31, 1776. An amendment
to the address referring to American affairs was defeated
in the lords by 91 to 26 and in the commons by 242 to 87.
The news of the victory at Brooklyn&mdash;"the terrible news," as
Fox indecently called it&mdash;and of the occupation of New York
strengthened the ministers; and on a motion to revise the acts
by which the Americans considered themselves aggrieved, the
minority in the commons sank to 47. Depressed by the exhibition
of their weakness, the Rockingham section ceased to attend
parliament except on the occasion of private bills in which they
were interested. Petulance and a false notion of dignity led
them to neglect their duty to their country and their party.
Their conduct was blamed by other whigs, and their secession,
though it occasioned discord in the opposition, did not paralyse
its efforts. Fox, by that time its most effective orator, went off
to Paris, and the king advised North to proceed with as much
business as possible in his absence.</p>

<p>The split in the opposition was specially manifested on the
introduction of a government bill in February, 1777, for a partial
suspension of the <i>habeas corpus</i> act, in order to secure the
detention of persons charged with high treason in America or
on the high seas; Rockingham, Burke, and others adhered to
their secession, while Dunning and Fox headed the minority in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the commons. Fox warned the house not to be deceived by
the amicable professions of the French ministers, who, he said,
were holding conferences with delegates from congress while
he was in Paris, and were only delaying to take part against
England until the French navy was in good order. He declared
that our losses were far greater and our successes far smaller than
they were represented by government, and inveighed against the
inhumanity with which he asserted the war was conducted on
our side. He attacked the solicitor-general, who in answering
him pointed out that if, as he asserted, France was secretly
intriguing against us the bill was specially necessary. In a
personal encounter Wedderburn was a dangerous antagonist,
and Fox met more than his match. Dunning urged an
amendment to prevent any abuse of the act; and North, always
averse from violent measures, accepted his proposal. The bill
was carried by 112 to 33. Public feeling had lately been excited
on the subject of treason by incendiary fires which did
much damage in the Portsmouth dockyard and destroyed some
buildings on Bristol quay. They were found to have been the
work of one James Aitken, commonly called John the painter,
who had lately returned from America, and who stated in his
confession that he had acted at the instigation of Silas Deane,
one of the emissaries of congress in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He was hanged at
Portsmouth on March 10.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_135" id="TOPIC_135"></a>The expenses of the war were growing. For 1777 parliament
voted 45,000 seamen, including 1,000 marines. The difficulty
was to get them. A seaman's service was not continuous; when
his ship was paid off he could go whither he would. The peace
establishment of the navy was ridiculously small, and when a
war broke out it was always difficult to get men in a hurry.
Many of the best seamen would have taken service on board
merchant ships and would, perhaps, be at sea; and life on the
king's ships in time of war was often so rough that it is not
surprising that men should have avoided it. The usual difficulty
of manning the fleet at the beginning of a war was increased at
the present time, for it was calculated that the revolt of the
colonies deprived England of 1,800 seamen. The navy in time
of war was recruited by impressment, a system which, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
recognised by common law, entailed much hardship. Seamen
were kidnapped, often after a bloody struggle, and if caught
inland were sent to the ports ironed like criminals. Men who
had been at sea for years were liable, as soon as their ships
neared home, to be taken out of them, put into a press tender
and sent to sea again. Merchant ships were stripped of their
best men, and were left to be brought into port by the master
and a few lads. The press gangs looked for trained seamen,
though when a war lasted for some years they took what they
could get; landsmen were impressed, and the press was sometimes
abused as a means of getting rid of a personal enemy, a
rival in love, or an inconvenient claimant. The system was
expensive; it was stated that from 4,000 to 5,000 seamen were
employed on the business, and that every pressed man who was
found to be fit for sea cost the nation &pound;30. High bounties were
offered, but they failed to entice men to enter a service which
the press might make practically continuous, and a proposal for
a limited term of service was rejected by the commons. The
supplies for the year amounted to &pound;12,592,534. New taxes
calculated to yield &pound;237,000 were laid on male servants, a
guinea on each, stamps, imported glass, auctioneers, and sales
by auction; and the deficiency of &pound;5,500,000 was met by a loan,
raised at 4 per cent., with a premium of &frac12; per cent. to meet the
state of the stocks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ARREARS OF THE CIVIL LIST.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_136" id="TOPIC_136"></a>While war was thus increasing the burden of the nation, the
king again applied to parliament for payment of the arrears of
the civil list, amounting to &pound;618,000. The ministers exhibited
accounts which failed to satisfy the opposition. Wilkes pointed
out that payments since 1769 of &pound;171,000 and &pound;114,000 for
secret service were each noted in a single line, and that there
was a general charge of &pound;438,000 for pensions. As in 1769,
the arrears must be traced to an expenditure which increased
the king's influence. Wilkes said this plainly, Burke in less
broad terms, and Fox taunted North with the pledge given
when he was in office in 1769 that no such demand should be
made again. Besides money deliberately spent in corruption,
vast sums were wasted on abuses in the royal household, on
sinecures, and on other useless places of profit. One of the
king's turnspits was a member of the house of commons, and
paid &pound;5 a year to a humble deputy, and no fewer than twenty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>three
separate tables were kept up, eleven for the nurses. For
such abuses George was only partially responsible. Though he
lived with a frugality which was almost meanness, he was in dire
distress for money; the wages of his menial servants were six
quarters in arrear, and he owed his coal-merchant &pound;6,000.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> After
much discussion the money was voted, and the civil list was
increased to &pound;900,000 a year. In presenting the bill to the
king the speaker, Sir Fletcher Norton, dwelt on the magnificence
of the gift, and added that the commons were confident that he
would apply wisely what they had granted liberally. Though
the court party in the commons declared that he had not expressed
the feeling of the house, he received a vote of thanks
for his speech. Towards the close of the session Chatham was
sufficiently recovered from his long illness again to attend parliament,
and moved an address to the crown to put an end to the
war. He pointed out the danger of foreign intervention, and
declared that France was already destroying our commerce.
The idea of conquering America was absurd; America would
not be conquered by the loss of ten pitched battles. He was
against American independence, but this country, he said, was
the aggressor, and "instead of exacting unconditional submission
from the colonies, we should grant them unconditional redress".
His motion was negatived by 99 votes to 28.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_137" id="TOPIC_137"></a>A fresh plan for obtaining the mastery of the line of the
Hudson was already in course of preparation. Burgoyne, who
returned home in December, obtained the command of the
northern army, and, on February 28, laid a project of campaign
before the government. He proposed to secure Ticonderoga
and the lakes, and march down the Hudson to Albany, where
he was to effect a junction with Howe, previously detaching a
small force to create a diversion by advancing from Oswego and
down the Mohawk river to Albany. The object of this plan was
to open communication between New York and Canada, cut off
New England from the southern provinces, and enable Howe
to operate in the south with an overwhelming force. He pointed
out the difficulties of the proposed march and suggested alternative
schemes; but his first project was chosen by the king,
and he was ordered to carry it out. The projected campaign, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
successful, would have been disastrous to the Americans. Its
success depended on Howe's co-operation. An invasion by distinct
armies, such as Burgoyne proposed, with bases far apart
and acting on converging lines, can only be undertaken with
safety when intercommunication is secure and co-operation
assured. Otherwise one of the invading armies is liable to be
crushed before it can receive help from another, specially when,
as was the case here, the enemy can act on lines interior to those
on which the invaders move. Burgoyne fell into the error,
common throughout the war, of trusting too much to loyalist
help. Apart from that, however, his project assumed that Howe
would be advancing up the Hudson in time to get between him
and any large force which might advance against him, and it
failed miserably, because Howe did not co-operate with him.
Germain informed Carleton of the plan and ordered him to
resign the command of the northern army to Burgoyne; he was
to command only within his own province, keeping 3,700 men
with him, and was to forward Burgoyne's expedition. Germain
reproached him for his retirement from Ticonderoga, which, he
said, gave Washington the means of breaking the British line at
Trenton. Carleton was indignant at this unworthy treatment,
and though he did what he could to help Burgoyne, he resigned
the governor-generalship.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_138" id="TOPIC_138"></a>During the winter Howe formed a plan for taking Philadelphia,
and on December 20, 1776, expounded it by letter to
Germain, observing that the northern army would not reach
Albany before September. Germain wrote on March 8 approving
of his plan,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> which might have been executed without
preventing the junction contemplated by the minister. After
some unimportant operations Howe took the field in June, and
on the 5th received a copy of Carleton's instructions relating
to Burgoyne's campaign. Washington's difficulties were then
somewhat relieved; he encamped at Middlebrook in a position
too strong to be forced; he would not be enticed to a general
engagement, and Howe could not leave him in his rear and push
on to Philadelphia. Time was passing, yet Howe was still set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
on prosecuting his design on Philadelphia. Finally he embarked
an army of 14,000 men at Sandy Hook, and instead of remaining
to be in readiness to co-operate with Burgoyne, left Clinton with
8,500 men to garrison New York and "act as circumstances may
direct," and on July 23 sailed for the Delaware, where he considered
he would be sufficiently near to New York to act with
Burgoyne, if necessary, and yet could carry out his own main
design. The naval officers were unwilling to risk disembarkation
in the Delaware, and Howe, determined not to give up his
design, sailed for Chesapeake bay. The fleet met with contrary
winds, and it was not until August 25 that his army landed at
the head of Elk river. Washington with about an equal force
marched to the north of the Brandywine to defend Philadelphia.
The two armies met on September 11. Howe, who well knew
how to handle an army in the field, out-man&oelig;uvred him, and
after some sharp fighting the American army was defeated with
a loss of over 1,400 men, killed, wounded, and taken, and eleven
guns. Congress again decamped, and on the 27th Cornwallis
took possession of Philadelphia amid the acclamations of a
large part of the inhabitants, while Howe and the main army
encamped at Germantown, five miles to the north.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOWE'S OBJECT ATTAINED.</i></div>

<p>In order to secure communication with New York and to
supply the army, it was all-important that the fleet should be
able to pass up the Delaware, which was strongly defended by
forts, a bar, and a fleet of little vessels; and Howe detached
troops to act against the forts. Washington lay a few miles to
the north; he was joined by strong reinforcements, and determined
to take advantage of the division of the British troops.
He formed a plan for surprising and driving in their advanced
posts, cutting their force in two, crushing their right wing, and
then doubling the whole army back on the Schuylkill river
where it would be at his mercy. He attacked at daybreak
on October 4 under cover of a fog. The head of the British
position was insufficiently guarded and the 40th regiment was
driven back. At this critical moment its commander, Musgrave,
and a party of his men stopped the enemy's advance by seizing
a house which stood in their way and holding it against them
until the army had time to form. His gallant conduct saved
the army. The Americans fought well until, misled by the fog,
one of their brigades fired on another. This threw them into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
disorder, which was increased by the drunkenness of some of
their officers and men. Cornwallis came up from Philadelphia
in hot haste and pressed upon them. They retreated with a loss
of 673 killed and wounded, and 400 taken; on the British side
the casualties were 551. Both in this action and in the battle on
the Brandywine the Americans showed that they had learned
to fight with resolution and to retreat in good order. The two
engagements proved that though they might be defeated in the
field, the war would not come to a speedy end, and this enlisted
foreign sympathy and encouraged France to intervene on their
side.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_139" id="TOPIC_139"></a>For a month Howe was engaged in opening the passage of
the Delaware. He sent for 4,000 men from New York. This
reduction of the garrison was most unfortunate, for, as we shall
see, it put an end to Clinton's attempt to co-operate with Burgoyne.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
At last the defences of the river were destroyed, and
communication was established between the army and the fleet.
Washington retreated to Valley Forge, about twenty-five miles
from Philadelphia, and there put his army into quarters. During
the winter his troops suffered terribly from lack of clothing
and provisions. By Christmas nearly 3,000 were unfit for duty
because they were "barefoot or otherwise naked". They deserted
in parties, a large number came to the British quarters,
and scarcely a day passed without the resignation of an officer.
In February, 1778, there was almost a famine in the camp, and
Washington feared a general mutiny and dispersion.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the British were in comfortable quarters in Philadelphia.
Howe's object was attained; but though the capture
of their capital discouraged the Americans, the loss of Philadelphia
is not to be compared with the loss of a capital of an
organised state; it did not paralyse an administrative machinery
or lessen the means of resistance. Howe's anxiety for its capture
largely proceeded from his expectation that it would be followed
by a rising of the loyalists; he placed too high a value on professions
of loyalty and on loyalist support. In itself the place
was important; it was the largest of the American towns, and
it opened communication between the northern and southern
provinces, though so long as an insurgent army existed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Pennsylvania, an invader could not safely take advantage of its
position. British officers marvelled that Howe did not attack
Washington while his army was in so miserable a state. His inactivity
cannot be defended satisfactorily. He was looking forward
to be relieved of his command; he was disgusted by the
inadequate response made by the government to his repeated
demands for large reinforcements; he informed Germain that
without 10,000 more troops the war would not be ended in the
next campaign, and on October 22 wrote resigning his command.
He allowed the discipline of his army to become lax. The
winter was spent in idleness and dissipation. A bank at faro
was opened, and many officers were ruined by gambling. All
ranks were demoralised, and sober townspeople who had welcomed
the arrival of the troops were disgusted by their disorderly
behaviour. The only fruit of Howe's victories during
the campaign of 1777 was the acquisition of good winter quarters
at Philadelphia, and that he purchased at the price of an
appalling disaster to a British army.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_140" id="TOPIC_140"></a>Burgoyne took the field in June with 7,251 rank and file of
regular troops, of which 3,116 were Germans, 148 militia, and
503 Indians, in all 7,902. Shortly before he left Canada a
small force set out under Colonel St. Leger to march from Lake
Ontario, take Fort Stanwix, and form a junction with him by an
advance through the Mohawk valley. Burgoyne's army was in
fine order, but the arrangements for the carriage of supplies and
the making of roads were insufficient. His troops were carried
up Lake Champlain and landed at Crown Point, where he made
a speech to his Indian allies, commanding them to observe the
customs of civilised warfare and to behave with humanity. He
was to find that such orders could not be enforced. On July
6, almost as soon as he arrived at Ticonderoga, the Americans
hastily abandoned it, leaving their guns behind them. They were
promptly pursued and suffered heavy losses. The fugitives
joined Schuyler, the commander of the army in the north, at
Fort Edward; he evacuated the place and retreated southwards
in the direction of Albany. The news of Burgoyne's success
caused much rejoicing in England. George is said to have
rushed into the queen's room as soon as he heard of it crying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
"I have beat them! beat all the Americans!" For the moment
the Americans were panic-struck. Men said angrily that their
troops would never hold a place until a general had been shot,
and Schuyler was superseded by Gates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BURGOYNE IN DIFFICULTIES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_141" id="TOPIC_141"></a>On July 10 Burgoyne set out to march from Skenesborough
to Fort Edward, sending his artillery and stores by water to Fort
George. His route, though not more than twenty miles, was extremely
difficult; it was obstructed by trees felled by the enemy
and lay through swamps and forests, and at least forty bridges
had to be constructed in its course. He might have avoided
these difficulties by returning to Ticonderoga and conveying
his army by water up Lake George; but he rejected that route
because he thought that a retrograde movement would discourage
his troops and abate the panic of the enemy. His army
did not reach the Hudson until the 30th. At Fort Edward his
supplies ran short and he had to wait there, for his means of
transport were not sufficient to bring his stores from Fort George.
Garrisons had to be found for Ticonderoga and for posts of
communication, and this diminished his army. Meanwhile the
enemy was increasing in force. While at Ticonderoga he published
a foolish proclamation reminding those who persisted in
rebellion that he had it in his power to let loose the Indians
upon them. Nothing would have induced him to commit so
hideous a crime, and his proclamation only served to enrage the
Americans and swell the number of their troops. The Indians
were offended by his efforts to restrain them, and deserted him;
they were no loss, for they caused more trouble than they were
worth, and some excesses which they committed, and specially
the murder of a Miss McCrae by an Indian who, it is said, was
sent by her betrothed to bring her into the British lines, excited
widespread indignation. Burgoyne was in sore need of supplies
and made an attempt to seize the insurgents' stores and horses
collected at Bennington. He sent only some 500 men on this
service, for he was assured that the district was friendly. It
was far otherwise. The party was surrounded on August 16,
and another detachment formed of German troops which was
despatched to help them marched so slowly that it did not
come up in time. Both bodies were defeated with a loss,
perhaps, of about 500 men.</p>

<p>News came of the failure of St. Leger's expedition. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
his arrival at Oswego he was joined by Sir John Johnson and
Butler with their loyalist regiments, and by a force of Indians
whom Johnson, one of their superintendents, and the Mohawk
leader, Brant, persuaded to march with them. He besieged
Fort Stanwix, and, on August 6, defeated a force sent to relieve
it. But his guns were too light for siege operations; the
garrison held out, and his Indians forced him to raise the siege.
During his retreat they mutinied; he was barely able to bring
off his regular troops, and lost his guns and stores. Burgoyne
was in a dangerous position; the country swarmed with enemies;
"wherever the king's troops point," he wrote, "militia to the
number of three or four thousand assemble in a few hours".
He might have retreated to Fort Edward, where he would have
had communication with Lake George; but he held that he was
bound by his orders to advance, and on September 15, after
collecting provisions for about a month, he conveyed his force
to the western bank of the Hudson and cut himself off from
communication with the lakes. Besides artillery, he had then with
him only 5,000 men under arms.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> On the 19th his force was
partially engaged by Arnold at Freeman's Farm. The British
held their ground but lost over 500 men, and Gates, the American
commander, with 11,000 men, who did not take part in the fight,
occupied a strong position in front of them. A message came
from Clinton that he was about to attack the forts on the Hudson
below Albany, and Burgoyne sent answer that he hoped to
be able to hold his ground until October 20. He fortified his
position and waited for further news. None came to him. The
insurgent forces grew to at least 16,000 men; Burgoyne's provisions
were becoming exhausted and on October 3 he put his
little army on half rations. Despite the overwhelming number
of the enemy, he moved forward on the 7th to ascertain whether
he could force a passage through their lines. He was defeated
with heavy loss and fell back on Saratoga.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SURRENDER OF BURGOYNE'S ARMY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_142" id="TOPIC_142"></a>A council of war held on the 12th decided on a retreat to
Fort Edward. It was too late; the Americans held the fords
and had a strong force encamped between Fort George and
Fort Edward. Only 3,500 fighting men were left with Burgoyne;
he was completely surrounded, and on the 14th he opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
negotiations with Gates. Even then he refused to surrender
unconditionally, and the convention of Saratoga was concluded
on the 17th. His troops marched out with the honours of war,
and were to be allowed to return to England on condition of not
serving again in the war. The whole number which surrendered,
including camp-followers, labourers, and detachments, was 5,762.
Gates's behaviour at the surrender was such as became an officer
and a gentleman. Congress shamefully broke the engagement.
The captive troops were marched to Boston, but when the
transports called for them, they were not allowed to embark.
The paltry subterfuges by which congress defended its conduct
only throw a specially odious light on its sacrifice of honour to
policy. From the beginning of the war both sides made frequent
complaints as to the treatment of prisoners, and both apparently
with justice. Burgoyne's men were shamefully treated. He and
his staff were allowed to return home in the spring of 1778;
others were exchanged from time to time, but the mass of the
army never came back. Clinton, who was then unaware of
Burgoyne's distress, did what he could to render his position
secure in case he arrived at Albany. As soon as he received
reinforcements from England, he pushed up the Hudson and on
October 6 destroyed the forts which barred the passage of our
ships. He could do no more, for he was forced to send 4,000
men to Howe and could not leave New York without a sufficient
garrison. A messenger from Burgoyne at last reached him.
The way being cleared, the ships ascended the river and burnt
the batteries and town at Esopus creek. The news of Clinton's
activity doubtless secured Burgoyne more favourable terms than
Gates was at first inclined to grant.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_143" id="TOPIC_143"></a>The chief blame for this disaster must rest on Howe. His
assertion that Philadelphia was the prime object of his campaign
made Germain uneasy, and he wrote to him on May 18 that
whatever he might meditate, he was not to neglect to co-operate
with the northern army.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> This despatch did not reach Howe
until August 16, when he had made co-operation with Burgoyne
impossible. A few days later Germain wrote again; the despatch
was not ready for his signature at the time at which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
wished to go into the country, and when he came back it was
forgotten. It was a piece of gross carelessness, but an undue
importance has been attached to it.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Howe was well aware of
Burgoyne's expedition. On June 5 he had received a copy of a
despatch from Germain which told him that Burgoyne was
ordered to "force his way to Albany" and join him with the
utmost speed.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Nevertheless, he persisted in pursuing his own
plan. He must have hesitated whether to reach Philadelphia by
land or water. When in June he at last made up his mind to
move, he evidently tried to reach Philadelphia by land. If he
had succeeded and had swept Washington before him, he might
have kept in communication with Burgoyne and have co-operated
with him. Failing in this, he decided to go by sea, and when he
was told that he could not safely land in the Delaware, went on
to Chesapeake bay. When he gained his object by taking Philadelphia
he did so by a course which made it impossible for
him to co-operate with Burgoyne, and put Washington's army
between them.</p>

<p>According to the government plan the chief object of his
campaign should have been his junction with Burgoyne. The
government, that is Germain, certainly erred in not giving him
precise orders, while Burgoyne had virtually no discretionary
power. Yet it was for Howe, as commander-in-chief on the
spot, to judge of the situation without explicit instructions.
According to his own statements, his view of the situation was
that Burgoyne would march through a friendly country and encounter
no enemy except the army of 4,000 men under Schuyler,
that Clinton would be able to give him any assistance which he
might require, that his own expedition to Philadelphia would
divert the enemy from Burgoyne, that he would be able to
"account for" Washington, and that if Washington gave him
the slip, he would be able to follow him up and prevent him
from annoying Burgoyne.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> These considerations may be supposed
to have satisfied him that no direct co-operation with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Burgoyne was required of him. Burgoyne had to encounter
foes whom neither he nor Howe reckoned upon, and it was
Howe's duty to be at hand to prevent their crushing him.
Burgoyne made some mistakes in preparing for and prosecuting
his campaign, but he and his men exhibited splendid courage,
and he is not to be blamed for trying his fortune to the utmost.
In view of his orders, and of the risk of leaving a co-operating
force unsupported, he was bound to ascertain whether he could
force his way through the enemy. The irregular character of
the American force rendered success possible, and justified his
gallant attempt of October 7. He was a fine soldier, and was
regarded with confidence and affection by his subordinates.
Clinton seems to have done all that was in his power considering
the small force left with him in New York.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EFFECT OF THE SURRENDER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_144" id="TOPIC_144"></a>The surrender of Burgoyne's army could not in itself affect
the issue of the war. Its importance lies in its effect on the
policy of foreign nations and specially of France. So far as
the Americans alone were concerned, England had good reason
to expect ultimate success. They would neither enlist in sufficient
numbers to keep up a regular army nor provide for such troops
as they had. The meddlesomeness and incapacity of congress
were destroying its army; generals were intriguing against one
another, soldiers were perishing for lack of necessaries, stores
were wasted. Money was scarce and public credit bad. Early
in 1778 congress had 5,500,000 paper dollars in circulation, and
the value of its paper dollar was from half to a quarter of the
silver dollar. Above all, the Americans had no fleet, and were
consequently unable to protect their sea-board. Their alliance
with France and subsequently with Spain brought them, along
with other help, the sea-power without which the issue of the
struggle might well have been adverse to them. France and
Spain hoped to recoup themselves for former losses, France by
conquests in the West Indies, Spain by regaining Gibraltar,
Minorca, and Jamaica. In 1775 an agent of the French court
went over to America with offers of help, and early in 1776 the
Count de Vergennes, foreign minister of Louis XVI., proposed
as a system of policy that the Bourbon kings should give secret
aid to the Americans and strengthen their own forces, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
care, however, to persuade England that their intentions were
pacific. About the same time congress sent Deane to France as
a secret agent.</p>

<p>In accordance with the proposal of Vergennes the French
and Spanish courts provided money for the Americans; and
Beaumarchais, the dramatist, who masqueraded as a firm of
merchants in order to conceal the participation of his government,
spent it in purchasing military stores for them. The
young Marquis de Lafayette and other Frenchmen entered their
army. So too did the Poles, Kosciusko and Pulaski, and the
Germans, Kalb and Steuben. In December Franklin went over
to Paris. The philosophic movement was then at its height in
France. The <i>philosophes</i> desired freedom of thought in religion,
constitutional liberty, and the abolition of privilege of all kinds.
They speculated as to the origins of political and social institutions
and the laws of human progress. The works of Voltaire,
Rousseau, and Montesquieu were eagerly studied by the nobles
and fine ladies of the court with whom <i>philosophisme</i> was
fashionable. America they regarded as a land of freedom and
primitive simplicity; and they hailed the crude assertions of the
Declaration of Independence, issued by a body largely composed
of slave-owners, that all men are created equal and with an inalienable
right to liberty, as bringing their theories within the
range of practical politics. Franklin was received with ludicrous
adulation as an embodiment of republican virtue and philosophic
thought. He busied himself in stirring up hostility to England.
Another American envoy sought help from Prussia. Frederick
showed his hatred of England by forbidding some German
troops which George had hired to pass through his dominions;
but his quarrel with Austria with reference to the Bavarian
succession rendered him unwilling to provoke Great Britain: he
had no sympathy with the Americans and would not receive
their envoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INTERVENTION OF FRANCE.</i></div>

<p>Besides the stores sent by Beaumarchais and 1,000 livres
in cash, France helped the Americans by neglecting to prevent
the violation of her neutrality by their ships. Although the
Americans could not dispute with Great Britain on the sea, they
had a few ships built by congress, more belonging to the maritime
provinces, and a vast number of privateers. These ships
did much damage to British trade. Already they hovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
about the coasts of England and Ireland, and were so dangerous
to our merchant vessels that merchants embarked their goods on
foreign ships to avoid the risk of capture. By the end of 1778
nearly 1,000 merchant ships were taken by American privateers.
Some of these privateers were fitted out in French ports, brought
their prizes into them, and sailed from them again on fresh
expeditions. Our ambassador, Lord Stormont, complained vigorously
of these open breaches of neutrality, and at last the
French government took some measures to stop them. The
opposition in parliament constantly insisted that, if the war
went on, France and Spain would certainly take part with the
Americans. The government could no longer ignore, though
it still strove to discredit, the danger of foreign intervention.
The king's speech at the opening of parliament on October 20,
1777, took note of the naval preparations of the two powers and
recommended an augmentation of the navy. Tidings of Burgoyne's
disaster reached Europe on December 2. Vergennes
at once informed the American agents that his master would
make a treaty with them. The alliance was concluded on February
6, 1778; it was agreed that, in the event of war between
France and England, neither of the contracting parties should
make peace without the consent of the other or until the independence
of the United States should be assured by treaty.
France renounced all claim to Canada. If taken from England,
it was to belong to the United States, while all conquests in the
West Indies were to belong to France. Spain at this time declined
to join in the alliance. That a treaty was signed was
soon generally believed in England; it was officially declared
by France on March 13. War between Great Britain and
France began in the summer.</p>

<p>With the intervention of France the war enters on a new
phase. Thenceforward England had to deal with more powerful
enemies than the Americans. The war had lasted for three
years and the rebellion was not crushed. Was it too much for
England to expect that she would subdue a people of her own
stock, as the Americans were then, separated from her by 3,000
miles of sea, and spread over a vast and difficult country? Had
she trusted to her navy, as Barrington and others desired, shut
the American ports, and held the towns on the coast and the
navigable rivers, the insurgents might possibly have been driven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to submission without any severe struggle. Conquest by land
was decided on. Was Chatham right in declaring in May,
1777, that England could not conquer the Americans? Six
months later a capable French officer serving in their army
wrote to the French minister of war that, unless his country
declared war against England, the Americans would fail to
obtain independence; so little enthusiasm for the cause was
there among them, so keenly did they feel the privations of the
war.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> In our war in South Africa of 1899-1902 the Boers
showed themselves better soldiers than the Americans, and were
not less brave; they were akin to us in race, and their country
was at least as difficult as America. In both wars our well-drilled
troops constantly found their previous training useless
or worse; in both we received loyal support from numerous
colonials on the spot. While improved means of transport
brought South Africa far nearer to us than America was in
the eighteenth century, the Boers were better prepared for
war than the Americans, and were a more martial people. Yet
England conquered them. So far, then, as the Americans alone
were concerned, Chatham's assertion must be denied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND'S CONDUCT OF THE WAR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_145" id="TOPIC_145"></a>Why then had England done so little in those three years?
There was much active loyalty on our side: thousands of colonials
fought for the crown during the course of the war; in the
central provinces at least half the population was for us.
Everything depended on the vigour and judgment with which
force was applied. In these respects there was failure both at
home and on the spot. In the first place the effort required
was underestimated. In February, 1774, Gage thought four
regiments would keep things quiet; in 1775 it was believed that
10,000 men would be enough; in January, 1776, Howe asked for
20,000, in November his estimate for the next year was 35,000.
Germain promised to raise his army to that number, yet instead
of 10,000 men he offered him only 7,800 rank and file. On
March 26 he confessed that he could only send 2,900, and
on April 19 that he had to subtract 400 of these for Canada.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
The country was strong for coercion, but recruits were hard
to raise; it willed the end but not the means. The king and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Germain interfered too much with the plans of operations. To
direct a war from the other side of the Atlantic in days when
letters between the secretary at war and the commander-in-chief
seem often to have been nearly two months on their way, was
to court failure.</p>

<p>At the outset of the war the enemy was unduly despised
both by ministers at home and soldiers in the field. As the
British general in command at Belmont is said to have rejected
a proposal for turning the Boers' position, declaring that he would
"put the fear of God into them," so Howe at Bunker hill delivered
a frontal attack on the enemy's entrenchments which cost
him over 1,000 men. Then he went to the opposite extreme of
over-caution. It is needless to recapitulate the occasions on
which either from over-caution or supineness he allowed great
opportunities to slip, as notably on Long Island. He, indeed, in
a greater degree than any one else is responsible for the British
failure to bring the war to an end. Every month improved the
fighting qualities of the Americans, under the judicious handling
of Washington, and at last France and the other enemies of
England saw that they might take them seriously and might
turn the war to their own profit.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>WAR WITH FRANCE AND SPAIN.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_146" id="TOPIC_146"></a>The surrender of Burgoyne's army was eagerly used by the opposition
as an opportunity for harassing the government. The
nation at large showed a worthier spirit by seeking to repair
its loss. Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, and Glasgow each
raised a regiment; and other regiments and companies were
raised in the Highlands and in Wales. In London and Bristol
the corporations refused to join the movement, but large sums
were subscribed by private persons for raising troops. The
opposition absurdly maintained that these levies were unconstitutional,
and Fox accounted for the zeal displayed by Manchester
and Scotland by observing that they were "accustomed to disgrace".
The ministers were bitterly reproached for employing
Germans and Indians. "If," said Chatham, "I were an American,
while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I would never
lay down my arms&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never." He condemned
the employment of Indians in the war in words of fiery eloquence.
It was certainly deplorable that they should have been employed.
In that matter, however, England had no choice. They would
have taken part in the war on one side or the other. They
had fought in every war between the English and French
in America, and while Pitt himself was conducting the war in
1760 Amherst used them with the authority of government.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
In the present war the Americans were the first to employ them,
and in 1776 congress resolved that it was expedient to do so
and authorised Washington to enlist 2,000 of them. They
were more ready to fight for the king than for the Americans,
who had treated them badly; and as they caused the insurgents
trouble and committed many shocking acts of barbarity, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Americans inveighed against us for employing them. If we
had not done so they would have fought for the Americans, as
some of them did. Otherwise we should have been better without
them, for no dependence could be placed upon them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE OPPOSITION DISUNITED.</i></div>

<p>Energetic as the opposition was in attack, it was not united
in policy. Chatham, zealous for England's imperial position, declared
that he would never consent to American independence.
There was yet time to make peace with the people of our own
blood and so be ready to meet our foreign foes. He proposed
a cessation of hostilities and an immediate offer of terms. All
that the Americans could demand as subjects should be granted,
and overtures made to them on the basis of political dependence
and the navigation act; that is, their trade should still be regulated
by duties. They would, he was sure, accept these terms.
If not, they must be compelled to obedience. The Americans
would certainly not have treated on his basis. Chatham had
repeatedly declared that it was impossible for us to conquer
them; yet he proposed that if his basis were rejected we should
use coercion after putting ourselves at a disadvantage by withdrawing
our army. Still, as there were many Americans besides
the loyalists who would have welcomed conciliation, and as the
proposed French alliance was unpopular, it is just possible that
had Chatham himself been prime minister some way might
have been found which, while securing to America virtual independence
such as England's self-governing colonies now enjoy,
might have prevented the severance of the bond. On the other
hand, the Rockingham party held that we should prevent the
alliance between France and America by acknowledging American
independence. This division between the two sections of
the opposition set them in hostile camps.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_147" id="TOPIC_147"></a>When people were convinced that the alliance was certain
the nation became uneasy, and a strong feeling prevailed, which
was shared by some of Chatham's opponents, that at such a
crisis England needed him at the head of affairs. In February,
1778, it was believed that he and Bute were engaged on some
scheme of coalition which might again put him in power. The
report was merely the outcome of the officious meddling of
his physician, Addington, and one of Bute's friends.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
was more anxious than North for a change of ministry. He
begged the king in vain to accept his resignation. On the 17th
he brought in two bills for a scheme of conciliation to which
George had at last given his sanction. He proposed an express
repeal of the tea duty, the surrender of all taxation except for
the regulation of trade, and the appointment of commissioners
to be sent to America with full powers to put an end to hostilities,
grant pardons, and treat with congress on any terms short
of independence. His proposals did not materially differ from
those made by Burke three years before. He declared that he
was not responsible for American taxation, that it was the work
of his predecessors, and that he had always desired conciliation.
He was heard with general consternation: his own party felt
that he was turning his back on the policy which they had
supported under his leadership; the opposition, that he was, as
it were, stealing their thunder. The bills were carried and the
king appointed the commissioners. They arrived in America
in June. Congress refused to listen to any offers short of independence;
the commissioners appealed to the American people,
and their manifesto was treated with contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S CONDUCT EXAMINED.</i></div>

<p>When the Franco-American alliance was announced, North
was urging the king to invite Chatham to take office and to
allow him to retire, and Shelburne was sounded as to the terms
on which Chatham would come in. He replied that he would
insist on "an entire new cabinet". George, who had unwillingly
agreed to this negotiation, was prepared to accept any men of
talent with a view of strengthening the existing ministry, but
not of forming another in its place, or of changing its measures.
He would not commission Chatham or any opposition leader
to form a new ministry: "no advantage to this country nor
personal danger to himself" would, he wrote to North, induce
him to do so; he would rather "lose his crown". "No consideration
in life," he wrote again, "shall make me stoop to the
opposition;" he would not give himself up "to bondage". His
determination has been pronounced equally criminal with the
acts which brought Charles I. to the scaffold.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> According to
our present ideas he should certainly have been guided by the
assurance of his first minister that the government was unequal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to the situation, have accepted his resignation, and allowed his
new ministers to act as they thought best. These duties, however,
were not, as we have seen, so clearly settled in those days. The
prime minister of our time was not then fully invented, and
George's plan of personal government through ministers was not
yet rejected by the country. He could still rely on the support
of parliament. A proposal to request the king to dismiss his
ministers was defeated at that very time by 263 to 113 in the
commons and by 100 to 36 in the lords. Chatham's return to
office would doubtless have been hailed with satisfaction by the
nation. Yet, though a change in public sentiment with regard
to the American war was beginning, and was soon to spread
rapidly, the king's policy was still popular with the larger part
of his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> When therefore his conduct in March, 1778, is
compared with that of Charles I. it should be remembered that
George had parliament and the mass of the nation at his back.</p>

<p>The personal light in which he regarded the question is inexcusable.
He had been disappointed and deeply offended by
Chatham's political conduct, and he had cause to fear that a
whig government would rob him of the power which he loved.
As a king he had no right to allow his private feelings to
affect his public action. That he did so was the result partly
of his system of personal rule, partly of serious defects in his
character, his implacability of temper, and his habit of regarding
all things as they affected himself. North struggled in vain
against his determination, and gave way before it. It is a mistake,
however, to regard the king as solely responsible for the
continuance of the war. If he is to be blamed because, rather
than submit to the loss of the colonies, which nearly all men
believed would be the end of England's greatness and prosperity,
he determined to carry on the struggle, the blame must
be shared by others. Had North been true to his convictions
George could not have formed another administration willing to
act on the same system. Had the majority of the commons
refused to support the king, the constitution afforded the means
of over-ruling his will.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_148" id="TOPIC_148"></a>Questions as to Chatham's return to power were soon to be
brought to an end. On April 7 he appeared in the lords after
a severe attack of illness, and, in faltering sentences, though with
some remains of his peculiar fire, protested against the surrender
of the sovereignty of America, "the dismemberment of this
ancient and most glorious monarchy". He urged that England
should refuse to bow before the house of Bourbon; "if we fall
let us fall like men". Richmond answered him by dwelling
on the expediency of acknowledging American independence;
otherwise, said he, "instead of Great Britain and America against
France and Spain, as in the last war, it will now be France, Spain,
and America against Great Britain". Chatham rose to reply and
fell back in a fit. He died on May 11. Parliament voted him
a public funeral, the stately statue which stands in Westminster
Abbey, &pound;20,000 for the payment of his debts, and a perpetual
pension of &pound;4,000 a year annexed to the earldom of Chatham.
Throughout his long career he was invariably courageous and
self-reliant; his genius was bold, his conceptions magnificent,
his political purity unsullied. His rhetoric was sublime. He
did not excel in debate or in prepared speeches. His spirit
burned like fire, and his speeches were the outpourings of his
heart in words which, while they owed something to art,
came spontaneously to his lips, and were not less lofty than
his thoughts. As a statesman he had serious defects; he was
haughty, vain, and overbearing, his opinions were unsettled, his
far-reaching views often nebulous; his passion was stronger than
his judgment, and he was immoderately given to bombast. In
spite of his true greatness he lacked simplicity, and he imported
the arts of a charlatan into political life. Yet Englishmen must
ever reverence his memory, for he loved England with all the
ardour of his soul, and, as Richmond said as he praised him to
his face on the day that he was stricken for death, "he raised
the glory of the nation to a higher pitch than had been known
at any former period".</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_149" id="TOPIC_149"></a>In 1778 the losses and expenses of the war and disappointment
at its results began to work a change in the feeling of the
country. In parliament tories sometimes voted with the opposition.
North continued to strive in vain to be released from
office. He made some overtures to the opposition. Fox, in spite
of the violence of his attacks, was anxious for a coalition, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
would have given him office, though he held first that Germain
only, and in 1779 that North himself and Sandwich, must be
excluded.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> He was restrained by Rockingham, and North's
efforts failed. The death of Chatham, though it united the opposition,
on the whole strengthened the ministry, and in June,
1778, it gained in ability by the appointment of Thurlow as
chancellor and Wedderburn as attorney-general. Burgoyne, who
was unfairly treated by Germain, was defended by Fox, and on
his return joined the opposition. The struggle in parliament
had a constitutional importance not overlooked by either party.
On the issue of the American war, "the king's war" as it was
called, depended the question whether George would be able to
establish his system of government by influence. The opposition
reckoned on failure in America, and hoped that, by exposing the
errors and corrupt practices of the government, they would so
rouse public feeling that, when the war ended in national humiliation,
the king would be forced to accept a minister imposed on
him by his people. No party can reckon on national humiliation
as a means of attaining its ends, however praiseworthy they may
be, without serious consequences to its own character. When
England was in extreme peril, the opposition, and Fox above all,
magnified her losses, encouraged her enemies by exposing her
weakness, and, not content with insisting on the maladministration
of the government, cavilled at every measure proposed for
the defence of her empire. Their conduct irritated their fellow-countrymen,
for the spirit of the nation was roused by the
intervention of France in the war with the colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ADMIRALTY ABUSES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_150" id="TOPIC_150"></a>Ample grounds existed for dissatisfaction with the government.
Unfortunately, this was specially the case with respect
to the navy. Its expenses had greatly increased. During the
eight years of the late war, 1755 to 1762, the money spent
upon it, exclusive of ordnance and votes for men, amounted to
no more than &pound;3,390,000; during eight years of Sandwich's
administration, 1771 to 1778, it was stated in parliament to have
been &pound;6,472,000.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> During the latter period there had been voted
for repairing and building ships &pound;2,900,000, and for extra stores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
for them &pound;600,000, in all &pound;3,500,000, enough, it was said, to
build 100 men-of-war and as many frigates. Nothing is so destructive
to efficiency as corruption. Under Sandwich abuses of
all kinds flourished. Many existed before his time, and things
grew worse under him. When in 1778 the naval estimates
for the year were laid before the commons, it was stated that
though &pound;27,000 had been voted between 1771 and 1775 for the
repair of the <i>Dragon</i> (74), and &pound;10,273 for her stores, the ship
was lying untouched and rotting at Portsmouth, and so in
various degrees with other ships. In reply, Welbore Ellis, the
treasurer of the navy, said that though estimates were the usual
way of raising money, the money once raised was spent at the
discretion of the admiralty. Indignant at this amazing statement,
Burke flung the smart book of estimates at the treasury
bench. Ships were built of foreign oak of an inferior kind
and needed constant repair; contracts were jobbed; stores were
wasted, stolen, and sold. The country paid for many more
seamen than it got; for example, in September, 1777, the number
returned as victualled was 51,715, though the seamen actually
serving were only 47,407. Greenwich hospital, with a revenue
of &pound;70,000, was a hot-bed of abuses.</p>

<p>What was the result of this corrupt system? How did our
navy stand in 1778 in comparison with the navies of France,
then at war with us, and Spain, which was on the eve of joining
against us? Choiseul's policy of naval reform was steadily
pursued, and in 1778 France had eighty ships of the line in good
order and 67,000 seamen. Spain followed the lead of France
and, when she entered the war in 1779, had about sixty ships of
the line. In 1778 we had 119 first, second, and third rates; of
this number there were, on Sandwich's showing, in November,
1777, excluding ships on foreign service, only thirty-five manned
and ready for sea, and seven which he said were nearly ready,
but some of the thirty-five were short of their full complement
of men, and there was a great scarcity of frigates. By July,
1778, the number ready was stated as forty-five. But when
Keppel put to sea in June, it was with difficulty that twenty-one
could be got ready to sail with him.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OFF USHANT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_151" id="TOPIC_151"></a>Keppel, though an opponent of the government, was appointed
to command the "grand," or, as it was called later, the
channel fleet, apparently at the king's wish. On July 27 he
engaged the French fleet from Brest under Count d'Orvilliers,
westward of Ushant, both having thirty ships of the line. An
indecisive action took place, the two fleets passing each other on
opposite tacks and exchanging broadsides. Sir Hugh Palliser,
the third in command and one of the lords of the admiralty, was
blamed for the resultless issue of the engagement. A quarrel
ensued between him and Keppel, which was made a matter of
party politics; the government upheld Palliser, the opposition
Keppel, and violent speeches were made in parliament. A
court-martial in 1779 honourably acquitted Keppel of the charges
which Palliser brought against him, and he received the thanks
of parliament. London was on his side; the mob gutted Palliser's
house and broke the windows of the admiralty and of
some official residences. Another court-martial acquitted Palliser
though with a slight censure. Keppel was annoyed by the position
taken up by the admiralty, notified his wish not to serve
again under the present ministry, and struck his flag. The rot
of faction, which was infecting political life, laid some hold on
the navy. Other naval officers declared that they would not
serve under Sandwich; the spirit of insubordination affected the
seamen and symptoms of mutiny appeared in the channel fleet.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_152" id="TOPIC_152"></a>The intervention of France forced England to contract her
operations in America. The project of isolating the northern
provinces was dropped, and thenceforward her efforts were mainly
directed towards the recovery of the southern colonies, in order
to secure their trade, and the suppression of privateering expeditions
from the New England coast. Howe was recalled at his
own request, and the chief command was given to Clinton, who
was ordered to withdraw from Philadelphia and concentrate upon
New York, where a French attack was expected. Philadelphia
was evacuated on June 18, 1778. Of its loyalist citizens 3,000
embarked for New York; those who remained behind were
harshly treated and two quaker gentlemen were hanged for
adhering to the enemy. As Clinton's army was marching
through New Jersey, the Americans tried to cut off his rear-guard
near Monmouth, but after an indecisive engagement failed
in their attempt. Clinton reached New York without further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span><a name="TOPIC_153" id="TOPIC_153"></a>
molestation, and soon afterwards Washington encamped at White
Plains. The Toulon fleet under Count d'Estaing arrived off
Sandy Hook on July 11, and Lord Howe with a far inferior
force prepared to defend the entrance to the port. While
D'Estaing lay outside, the wind rose; he was afraid to risk his
ships by an attempt to cross the bar, and sailed away southwards,
for Washington persuaded him to attack Newport in
conjunction with an army under Sullivan. Lord Howe followed
him, and arrived at Point Judith on August 9, the day after
the French ships passed the batteries. D'Estaing stood out to
sea to meet him. Howe's fleet, though reinforced, was still
much the weaker, but "Black Dick," as the sailors called him,
was master of his profession and out-man&oelig;uvred D'Estaing who
was a cavalry officer turned admiral. A storm dispersed both
fleets and D'Estaing, after collecting his ships, sailed off to Boston
to refit. Sullivan retreated and got away from Rhode Island a
day before Clinton arrived with 4,000 men. Lord Howe soon
afterwards resigned his command, declaring that he would not
serve again under the present ministers. D'Estaing sailed from
Boston to the West Indies, leaving the American populace furious
at his departure from Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Clinton was called upon to send 5,000 men to the West
Indies, Washington was badly supported by congress, and
neither was in a position to act against the other. Successful
expeditions were made in the autumn against the privateering
haunts of the insurgents, Buzzard's bay, Martha's Vineyard, and
on the New Jersey coast; many ships were taken and much
damage was done. The western frontiers were raided by the
tory troops of Johnson and Butler and by our Indian allies.
Shocking barbarities were committed, specially in the Wyoming
valley, where the prisoners were massacred by the Indians, though
there the women and children were spared, and at Cherry Valley,
where there was a general massacre during the attack. In 1779
the Americans retaliated on the Indians with fearful severity,
and cruelly wasted the lands of the Senecas and Cayugas and
the settlements in the Alleghany.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MISTAKEN NAVAL POLICY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_154" id="TOPIC_154"></a>Neither the operations on the coast nor the border fighting
had any material influence on the progress of the war. By the
end of 1778, however, the war entered on a new and, as it proved,
decisive phase; it became a struggle for the southern provinces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
In November Clinton sent a small force by sea under Colonel
Campbell to invade Georgia. Campbell routed the Americans
and took Savannah; and General Prevost, who joined him from
Florida, easily obtained possession of the province. Lincoln's
attempt to regain it was defeated at Briar creek on March 3,
1779, and Prevost penetrated into South Carolina. He finally
retired to Georgia, leaving a garrison at Port Royal, which
secured his access to the sea and gave him a footing in South
Carolina, as well as a base for covering Georgia. The campaign
was a promising opening of operations in the south.</p>

<p>When news of the outbreak of the war reached the West
Indies, the French governor of Martinique seized Dominica,
while Admiral Barrington, in command of a small squadron at
Barbadoes, was waiting for orders. As soon as Barrington received
the reinforcements sent by Clinton, he attacked St. Lucia.
D'Estaing came over from America with a fleet of twice the
size, but failed to engage our ships closely, and, after some
fighting on the island, in which the French lost heavily, sailed
off to Martinique. St. Lucia was surrendered on December 29.
Nothing further of importance took place in those parts until
the summer of 1779, when D'Estaing seized St. Vincent while
Byron, who was then in command, was engaged in guarding a
convoy. D'Estaing then sailed with all his fleet to Grenada and
forced the garrison to surrender. Byron, though encumbered by
a number of transports and with a smaller fleet, engaged him in
the hope of relieving the island. Some of Byron's ships suffered
badly, and when he found that the garrison had surrendered, he
sailed off. D'Estaing did not press his advantage, for his sole
object was to secure his conquest, and only one transport ship
was taken. England was no longer supreme by sea. The
fault lay not with her admirals, who were still skilful, nor with
her seamen, who were as bold as ever. Her weakness was due
to her government, which first allowed the navy to fall into an
inefficient condition and then adopted a wrong system of naval
warfare. She began the contest unprepared, and instead of
preventing the fleets of the enemy from reaching the ocean,
had to fight in distant parts with inferior forces. As the war
went on strenuous efforts brought her navy to a higher pitch;
yet she still neglected her first line of defence, did not concentrate
her forces off the ports of the enemy, and strove to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

<p><a name="TOPIC_155" id="TOPIC_155"></a>After much hesitation Spain made alliance with France
against England on April 12. The treaty, which did not include
the Americans, provided that Spain should recognise their
independence and that the two contracting powers should invade
England; and the reconquest of Gibraltar and Minorca, the acquisition
of the coast of Florida, and the expulsion of the English
from Honduras were mentioned among the objects which Spain
desired to effect. She did not declare war until June 16, in order
that the two fleets might have time to prepare for united action.
England received the news of the combination with spirit; volunteers
enlisted for defence and large sums were subscribed
for raising troops, equipping privateers, and other patriotic purposes.
The Spaniards at once blockaded Gibraltar, then under
the command of General Eliott, and began that three years'
siege which is one of the most honourable incidents in our
military history. Though the home fleet, under the command
of Sir Charles Hardy, lay in the Bay of Biscay on the look out
for the allied fleets, they effected a junction, got between him
and Plymouth, and in August sixty French and Spanish ships
of the line and a crowd of smaller vessels paraded before the
town. English pride was deeply wounded, and the landing of
the enemy was daily expected. But the vast fleet accomplished
nothing save the capture of one ship of the line. Its crews were
wasted by sickness, and when a change of wind enabled Hardy
to enter the Channel, the enemy did not follow him into its
narrower waters and early in September left our shores.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VARIOUS INCIDENTS OF NAVAL WARFARE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_156" id="TOPIC_156"></a>The war was carried on in many parts of the world, and was
full of incidents which, as they had little or no effect on its
issue, must only be noticed briefly. In October, 1778, Pondicherry
was taken by the East India Company's troops, and the
French lost all their settlements in India. One of them, Mah&eacute;,
was claimed by Haidar as tributary to him, and its capture afforded
him a pretext for making war on us. He overran the Karnatic
in 1780, defeated a British force, took Arcot, and reduced Madras
to great straits. In the spring of 1779 the French made a feeble
attack on Jersey, and were repulsed by the 78th regiment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the militia of the island. The British factories at Senegal were
seized by the French, and Goree by the English. The Spaniards
expelled our logwood cutters from Honduras in August, and
about the same time the Spanish governor of Louisiana reduced
West Florida, which was thinly inhabited and almost undefended.
The enemies of England hoped to break her power by destroying
her commerce, but it was too large and various to be ruined
by casual losses, and too carefully protected to incur a series of
them. While the trade of France with the West Indies was
almost ruined, the English Jamaica fleet reached home in safety
a few days after the enemy left the Channel. Privateers and
king's ships did so much damage to the commerce of France
and Spain in 1779 that it was held to counterbalance the
loss of St. Vincent and Grenada. American cruisers were still
troublesome. Paul Jones, a Scottish sailor, who held a commission
from congress, infested the coasts of Scotland and Ireland,
and in 1779 received a ship from the French government,
which he called the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>. With her and four
smaller vessels he sailed from Brest, and fell in with the homeward-bound
Baltic fleet convoyed by the <i>Serapis</i>, Captain Pearson,
and a sloop of war. Pearson engaged the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i>, and after a desperate fight the two English ships were
forced to strike. His gallant conduct saved the convoy, and
the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> was so severely mauled that she sank
the next day. The Americans suffered at least as heavily as
the English from this desultory warfare, and their privateering
ventures were checked by operations on their coast.</p>

<p>While Washington was encamped in the high lands north
of New York, guarding his position by forts on the Hudson, and
specially by the fortification of West Point, Clinton took two
posts which commanded the passage of the river, and, in conjunction
with Admiral Sir George Collier, distressed the enemy
by various expeditions. The New England coast was thoroughly
scoured by Collier's squadron, some towns on the Chesapeake
were invaded, a great quantity of stores seized, and about a
hundred and twenty vessels taken or destroyed. Partly in the
vain hope of drawing Washington down from his position, and
partly in order to cut off one of the main sources of his supply,
a force from New York was landed in Connecticut, some towns
on the coast were destroyed, and stores and shipping burnt or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
carried off. Further operations there were stopped by an expedition
from Boston against a British post established in Penobscot
bay, to check the incursions of the enemy into Nova Scotia.
As soon as Collier appeared in the Penobscot river the Americans
burnt most of their ships; he captured the rest, and the
whole naval force of Massachusetts was destroyed.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_157" id="TOPIC_157"></a>In the autumn Lincoln persuaded D'Estaing to bring his
fleet from the West Indies and join him in driving the British
out of Georgia. The French and Americans, about 10,000
strong, laid siege to Savannah, which was defended by Prevost
with a force of only 2,500 men. An assault was made on the
place on October 9, and was repulsed with heavy loss. The
siege was abandoned; D'Estaing with most of his ships sailed
for France, and the American army retreated into South Carolina.
D'Estaing's arrival on the coast warned Clinton of the
necessity for concentration, and he ordered the evacuation of
Rhode Island. When the French fleet had departed he prepared
to attack Charleston, and on February 11, 1780, landed
his army on the coast of South Carolina. The town, which was
defended by Lincoln, was besieged on April 1, and surrendered
on May 12. More than 5,000 prisoners were taken, including
seven general officers, besides about 1,000 French and American
seamen, 400 guns, and the whole naval force in the harbour.
Cornwallis obtained further successes in the province; South
Carolina was cleared of the enemy, and the inhabitants generally
professed submission. After striking this great blow Clinton
was forced to return to New York, for a French fleet was
bringing over troops to act with Washington, and Cornwallis
was left with only 4,000 regulars, besides provincials, to carry
on the war in the south.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FIGHTING IN LINE OF BATTLE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_158" id="TOPIC_158"></a>By the end of 1779 the garrison of Gibraltar was reduced
to great straits. The West India command had lately been
given to Rodney, already a distinguished officer and destined
to take a high place among England's sea-captains. Before he
proceeded to his station he sailed with a large convoy for
Gibraltar and Minorca. On his way he captured a Spanish
convoy, sent the sixty-four-gun ship which protected it to England
with the merchandise, and carried the provisions destined for
the besiegers off Gibraltar to the besieged garrison. Off Cape
St. Vincent he came on a Spanish squadron of inferior strength<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
under the command of Don Juan de L&aacute;ngara, cut the Spaniards
off from Cadiz, took six of their ships, and destroyed another.
He carried out the relief of Gibraltar and on February 13 sailed
for the West Indies, where Count de Guichen was commanding
in place of D'Estaing. Down to this time the naval battles of the
century had generally been inconclusive, except when one fleet
was much stronger than the other. Admirals kept strictly to
the formation known as the line of battle in which one ship
followed another in regular order. If both the admirals of opposing
fleets were willing to bring matters to a decided issue,
the fleet to windward would attack, and the ships go at one
another at close quarters all along the line. English admirals,
with sufficient force, always hoped to bring this about. They
were seldom successful, for the French admirals were unwilling
to fight at close quarters, not because they were afraid to meet
the British, but partly because they generally had some other
object in view than the destruction of the enemy's fleet, some
conquest to make or some place to protect, and partly because
the French having fewer ships were indisposed to make free use
of them in battle. Accordingly a French admiral preferred the
leeward position. This enabled him to avoid a decisive action,
for when a British fleet bore down on him, he could cripple our
leading ships in their rigging, and then break off the action by
running before the wind.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_159" id="TOPIC_159"></a>Rodney made the destruction of the enemy's fleet his first
aim. There was only one way of accomplishing it. That was
by deserting the old system of fighting in line, van to van,
centre to centre, rear to rear. He sighted Guichen's fleet on
April 16 as it was sailing northwards and well to leeward of
Dominica. Guichen was convoying merchantmen, and intended
ultimately to attack Barbadoes. The two fleets were nearly of
equal strength. Rodney gained the windward position, and
engaged the next morning. He planned to bring the whole of
his force to bear on the French centre and rear. After much
man&oelig;uvring the opportunity came. Unfortunately his captains,
accustomed to the old routine, did not understand his signal.
His well-devised plan was defeated and the battle was as inconclusive
as its predecessors. Rodney was bitterly disappointed,
for a decisive victory seemed within his grasp.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> He considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that some of his captains did not behave with sufficient promptitude
and set himself to bring his fleet to a high pitch of efficiency.
Guichen was joined by a Spanish fleet which gave him a great
numerical superiority. It was no profit to him; the Spanish
ships were hot-beds of disease and he had to convoy them to
San Domingo. Then he sailed off for France with the larger
part of his force. By that time the hurricane season was at
hand and Rodney divided his fleet, leaving about half in the
West Indies, and sailing with the remainder to New York, where
he arrived on September 12. England had full command of
the sea in the American waters, and Rodney did little there and,
unfortunately, as we shall see in our next chapter, less than he
might have done. At New York his squadron escaped the
hurricane which swept over the West Indies on October 10.
As Rodney was a tory his distinguished services were peculiarly
gratifying to the king and the government. He was created a
Knight of the Bath and received a pension with remainder to
his children.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESTRAINTS ON IRISH TRADE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_160" id="TOPIC_160"></a>The war brought Ireland an opportunity for insisting on a
redress of grievances. By 1773 the prodigality of government
raised the national expenditure far above the revenue. Lord
Harcourt, the viceroy, recommended a tax of 10 per cent. on the
rents of absentees. The proposal was popular in Ireland, and
North was willing to agree to it. The great Irish landlords of
the Rockingham party were strongly opposed to the tax, and
Burke argued that it would hinder Irishmen from taking part in
the political life of Great Britain and would imply that England
was a foreign land. A strong feeling against the tax was
excited in England. North gave way and, in obedience to
instructions, Harcourt procured the rejection of the bill. The
grievances of the country increased. The American war was
unpopular with the presbyterians, the peace and safety of the
land were imperilled by the withdrawal of its troops, its finances
were burdened by pensions and by grants for the war, and the
public debt which in 1770 was &pound;669,230, entailing a charge of
&pound;26,631, stood in 1778 at &pound;939,323, with a charge of &pound;82,711.
The restrictions on Irish trade were rendered specially grievous
by the war. An embargo laid on the export of provisions from
Ireland ruined her trade in cattle. Debarred from the woollen
manufacture in the interest of English industry, she had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
encouraged to manufacture linen, and her trade in linen prospered.
The war with America deprived her of her principal
market. The restraints placed upon her commerce with England
brought her into close commercial connexion with France,
and that source of profit was also cut off in 1778. Many of
her people were driven abroad by want; and the poor who remained
were only kept alive by charity.</p>

<p>In 1778 proposals were made in the English parliament
to relax the restrictions on Irish trade. North approved of
the proposals, and they were powerfully supported by Burke.
Liverpool, Bristol, and other English manufacturing towns protested
loudly against admitting Ireland to compete with them.
North yielded to pressure, and the supporters of the bills were
forced to accept a measure which was wholly insufficient to
satisfy the needs of the Irish. The disappointment in Ireland
was bitter. Something, however, was gained; the system of
restriction was no longer intact. The same year saw the beginning
of a relaxation of the penal code. Common wrongs and
common aspirations helped to subdue religious animosity. The
cause of the catholics was urged in the Irish Parliament by the
splendid oratory of Henry Grattan. A bill was passed enabling
them to take leases for 999 years and, except in the case of
converts, to inherit land as freely as protestants. The law was
no longer to offer an inducement to a man to abandon his
father's faith for the sake of gain; it was no longer to put the
estate of a catholic father under the power of a professedly
protestant son.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_161" id="TOPIC_161"></a>The failure of the attempt to obtain relief from commercial
restrictions taught the Irish that England would not sacrifice her
own interests to relieve their distress, and that they must help
themselves. Following the example of the Americans, they
formed associations for non-importation. These associations
showed the English manufacturers that Ireland could retaliate
upon them. England was, however, forced to concession by
another means. The assent of the Irish parliament to England's
proposal that drafts should be sent to the war from the 12,000
men who should have been kept for the defence of the country,
reduced the number of troops in Ireland to less than 5,000.
The coasts were infested by privateers and a French invasion
was expected. England had no troops to spare and her fleets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span><a name="TOPIC_162" id="TOPIC_162"></a>
were fully engaged. Abandoned by government, the Irish
protestants took up arms to defend their own country. The
Duke of Leinster and Lord Charlemont threw themselves eagerly
into the movement, which was supported by the majority of
the Irish gentry, catholics as well as protestants; though for
some time the catholics did not volunteer because they were
disqualified from bearing arms. Before long 42,000 volunteers
were learning military discipline, arms were purchased and
officers chosen. The Irish government regarded the movement
with uneasiness, but took advantage of it as a protection against
invasion, and distributed 16,000 stands of arms among the
corps. The volunteers, while thoroughly loyal, adopted a distinctly
national policy. England was in difficulties and could
not withstand the demands of so powerful a body. In the
session of 1779-80 parliament, at North's instance, abandoned
the system of restriction on Ireland's trade; threw open to her
trade with the colonies and repealed the acts restraining the
exportation of her woollens and glass. About the same time
the influence of the volunteers procured the assent of government
to a bill releasing Irish dissenters from the sacramental test.
Great as these gains were, Irish aspirations reached further. On
April 19, 1780, Grattan proposed a declaration of legislative
independence. For that the Irish parliament was not ready.
Lord Buckinghamshire, the viceroy, secured support by lavish
promises of recommendations for peerages and other good
things, and parliament deserted the popular cause. In December,
Buckinghamshire was succeeded by Lord Carlisle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AGITATION FOR ECONOMICAL REFORM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_163" id="TOPIC_163"></a>During 1779 North's government lost ground; the ministers
were known to be divided in opinion, and various parliamentary
inquiries into the conduct of the war revealed much maladministration.
Even the king said that Germain was "of no
use in his department," and Fox's vote of censure on the
admiralty was supported by a minority of 170. Some changes
in the ministry failed to strengthen it. In 1778 Jenkinson
succeeded Barrington as secretary at war; he lived to prove
himself a man of ability, but in his new office he, like his predecessor,
had merely to carry out the orders of others. Gower,
a strong advocate of American coercion in 1775, changed his
opinions, resigned the presidentship of the council in November,
1779, and made a violent attack on the government. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
succeeded by Lord Bathurst the ex-chancellor. Suffolk died
and was succeeded as southern secretary by Lord Stormont, and
Weymouth, the northern secretary, by Hillsborough. North
still urged the king to accept his resignation. George, conscious
of the shortcomings of the ministry, gave Thurlow authority
to treat with Shelburne, as head of the Chatham party, with
a view to the formation of a strong administration, composed
of men of different parties, to be formed without North, and
independently of the existing ministry. Grafton persuaded
Shelburne not to act apart from the Rockingham whigs. The
united opposition would have insisted on a complete change of
measures as well as of men, which would have implied the
surrender of America. To this George would not consent, and
North was again persuaded to remain in office. On the meeting
of parliament in November, 1779, the ministers carried the
address by 233 to 134, a majority which bore out the assertion
of the king's speech that parliament was with him, and the
speech added "my people at large".</p>

<p>Yet though the declaration of war by Spain called forth a
loyal address, unanimously voted by the commons, assuring the
king of their help against the Americans, many held that it
would be well to withdraw the troops from America and use
the whole strength of the country against its foreign enemies.
The expenses of the war were heavy; additions were made to
the public debt of &pound;6,000,000 in 1778, of &pound;7,000,000 in 1779,
and of &pound;12,000,000 in 1780, and many new taxes were imposed.
At the same time large sums were expended on maintaining
useless offices, a crowd of pensioners, and other abuses, the
means by which the king kept his hold on parliament. The
whigs determined to take advantage of the demands made on
the nation to strike at the root of that corrupt influence by insisting
on public economy. The attack was begun unsuccessfully
in the lords by Richmond and Shelburne, and in December
Burke gave notice that he would lay a plan of economical reform
before the commons. The whigs sought to bring pressure to
bear on parliament by an appeal to the people and met with a
ready response. A county meeting at York, presided over by
Sir George Savile, sent a petition to the commons for public
economy, and formed an association to promote that object and
the restoration of the independence of parliament. Twenty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
other counties and some cities and towns sent similar petitions
and most of them formed associations. On February 11, 1780,
Burke introduced his plan in a speech of remarkable ability.
He proposed a reform of the king's civil establishment, the
abolition of a crowd of court offices, a reform of certain public
departments, the limitation of pensions, the sale of the crown
lands, and the abolition of the jurisdictions of Wales, Cornwall,
Chester, and Lancaster. His bills were destroyed piecemeal in
committee, and the only result of his scheme which, if fully
carried out, would, he calculated, have saved the nation over
&pound;1,000,000 a year, was the abolition of the board of trade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a sharp struggle went on in the commons. A
proposal for an account of patent places was agreed to, but
another for submitting a list of pensions was lost by two votes.
A crowded meeting was held at Westminster on April 5 and
was addressed by Fox who, with vehement eloquence, recommended
annual parliaments and an addition of 100 county
members as a means of freeing parliament from the influence
of the crown. Government apprehended an attempt to overawe
parliament and stationed soldiers in the neighbourhood of Westminster
Hall. This step enraged the opposition, and on the 6th
Dunning proposed a resolution in the commons that "the influence
of the crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to
be diminished". This resolution was carried, with a trifling
addition, by 233 to 215, and another that the house was competent
to correct abuses in the civil list was adopted without a
division. On the 10th, however, a resolution that certain officers
of the household should be disqualified from sitting in the house
of commons was carried by two only. So far did pressure from
without combined with the near prospect of a general election
carry the commons, but the majority did not desire reform and
would go no further than general resolutions. An address to the
king, praying that he would not dissolve nor prorogue parliament
until measures had been taken to diminish the influence of the
crown, was rejected by a majority of fifty-one. The struggle was
over, and Fox vented his rage and disappointment in a speech
of unmeasured invective. Throughout the session much heated
language was used in parliament, and both Shelburne and Fox
fought duels in consequence of words uttered by them in debate.
On June 2 Richmond, ultra-democratic as a democratic noble is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
wont to be, specially on questions not affecting his own order,
was urging annual parliaments and manhood suffrage on the
lords when he was interrupted by an outbreak of mob violence,
a bitter answer to his arguments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GORDON RIOTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_164" id="TOPIC_164"></a>The earlier half of the reign saw an increase in religious
tolerance. Though the whig movement for relieving dissenting
ministers from subscription to the articles was defeated by
the lords in 1772 and 1773, a bill supported by both parties
granted them relief in 1779, the year in which the Irish dissenters
were relieved from the test act. The whigs, as we have
seen with reference to the Quebec act, were opposed to any
measure of relief being granted to Roman catholics, who were
by law liable to cruel oppression. The judges, indeed, and
specially the great chief-justice, Mansfield, did all they could to
mitigate the rigour of the law, yet catholics lived in insecurity,
and so late as 1767 a priest was condemned to imprisonment for
life, and was actually imprisoned for four years, for exercising
his office. Whig prejudices gave way, and in 1778 Sir George
Savile brought in a bill enabling catholics who abjured the
temporal jurisdiction of the pope to purchase and inherit land,
and freeing their priests from liability to imprisonment. The bill,
which only affected England, was passed without a division in
either house, and the government proposed to bring in a like
bill for Scotland the next year. Violent protestant riots took
place in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and such strong feeling was
generally manifested in Scotland against the proposed measure
that it was abandoned. The relief act excited discontent in
England, and protestant fanatics, encouraged by the success of
their party in Scotland, agitated for its repeal. A protestant
association was formed, a crack-brained member of parliament,
Lord George Gordon, was made president, and a petition for
the repeal of the act was signed by nearly 120,000 persons.</p>

<p>On June 2, 1780, some 60,000 persons marched under
Gordon's leadership to Westminster with their monster petition.
They violently assaulted many peers and compelled members
of both houses to cry No popery! and to put blue cockades
in their hats. Gordon addressed them, and named Burke and
other members as specially hostile to their cause. The commons
refused to give the petition immediate consideration; the lobbies
were thronged by the mob, and North sent for the lifeguards to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
protect parliament. On their arrival the mob left palace-yard
and partially destroyed the chapels of the Sardinian embassy
in Duke street, Lincoln's inn Fields and the Bavarian embassy in
Warwick street, Golden square. The next day was fairly quiet,
but on Sunday, the 4th, finding that no measures were taken
to enforce order, they sacked other catholic chapels and some
houses. By Monday the riots assumed a more dangerous character;
the mob passed out of the leadership of religious fanatics
and was bent on plunder and destruction. East of Charing Cross
London was almost at its mercy. There was no efficient police
force; military officers and soldiers had learnt the risk they would
incur by firing on a mob without the order of the civil power,
and the magistrates were for the most part timid and inactive.
Wilkes was an honourable exception, and showed courage and
firmness in dealing with the rioters. Virtually unchecked, the
mob sacked chapels and houses, plundered shops, and burnt
Savile's furniture before his door. During the next two days
Newgate was partly burnt and the prison broken open, the
other principal prisons either destroyed or damaged and the
prisoners set at liberty. Some magistrates' houses were plundered
and burnt. Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury square was
sacked and his splendid library, pictures, plate, and furniture
destroyed. By Wednesday night thirty-six fires were blazing
in different parts; volumes of flame were rising from the King's
bench and Fleet prisons, the new Bridewell, and the toll gates
on Blackfriars bridge, and the lower end of Holborn was burning
fiercely. A great distillery in Holborn was wrecked; men
and women killed themselves by drinking the unrectified spirits
which were brought into the streets, and others who were drunk
perished in the flames or were buried in the ruins. Attacks
were made on the Bank of England and the Pay Office. Both
were guarded by soldiers, and the rioters were repulsed with
heavy loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S PERSONAL INTERVENTION.</i></div>

<p>By that time the general paralysis of authority was ended
by the king's personal intervention. As his ministers seemed
afraid of incurring responsibility, George summoned a meeting
of the council by special command on Wednesday morning.
Finding that the council hesitated to recommend the employment
of troops, he said that if they would not give him advice
he would act without it, and that he could answer for one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
magistrate who would do his duty. He bade Wedderburn, the
attorney-general, declare the law on the subject. Wedderburn
replied that the king in council could order soldiers to suppress
a riot without the authority of a magistrate. George at once
ordered the military to act, and by Thursday morning the riots
were quelled. Seventy-two houses and four gaols had been
destroyed. Of the rioters, 285 were reported as killed and 173
wounded, but many more lost their lives during the riots. The
trials of the rioters were conducted with moderation; of the 139
who were tried, fifty-nine were capitally convicted, and of these
only twenty-one were executed. The Surrey prisoners were
tried before Wedderburn, who was made chief-justice of the
common pleas and created Lord Loughborough. Lord George
Gordon was acquitted; he was imprisoned for a libel in 1787,
and died in Newgate after having become a jew. When the
lords, who adjourned on the 6th, again assembled, the great
jurist Mansfield, who in his seventy-sixth year retained his
mastery of constitutional law and his facility of expression,
authoritatively declared that soldiers equally with civil persons
might, and if required by a magistrate must, assist in suppressing
riots and preventing acts of treason and felony, and that
the red coat of a soldier neither disqualified him from performing
the duty of a citizen nor would protect him if he transgressed
it. The riots seem to have improved the position of the government,
for the appeal to popular feeling and the formation of
associations by which the whigs brought pressure on parliament
were discredited by them, and for the moment common danger
allayed political animosity.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>YORKTOWN AND THE KING'S DEFEAT.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_165" id="TOPIC_165"></a>In 1780 England's enemies increased in number and her isolation
was complete. From early times all belligerent nations
subjected to capture the goods of an enemy in neutral ships.
This usage was interrupted only by treaties. It was specially
disliked by the Dutch, as great carriers by sea, and they
made many treaties with different powers, stipulating that
goods carried in their ships, not being contraband, should be
free. In 1778 France, in order to injure England, declared its
adoption of the principle that neutral ships made neutral goods.
The lesser Baltic nations, which largely exported naval material,
were anxious to protect their commerce from England, specially
as she was rigorous in her view with regard to contraband goods;
and they looked to Russia to help them. Frederick of Prussia,
always eager to do England a bad turn, used his influence with
the Empress Catherine in the cause of the freedom of commerce
in neutral ships, and was supported by her minister, Panin.
Catherine, though not unfriendly towards England, yielded to his
representations, and in March, 1780, notified England, France,
and Spain that, while in other respects she would maintain strict
neutrality, she would enforce by her fleets four propositions:
(1) that neutral ships may freely sail from port to port of a
belligerent nation; (2) that goods carried by them, not being contraband,
should be free from seizure; (3) that only certain specified
goods were contraband; and (4) that no blockade should
be recognised which was not effectual. France, Spain, and
the Americans at once accepted these propositions; Denmark,
Sweden, Prussia, and the Emperor joined the league of "armed
neutrality" in the course of the year, and the accession of Holland
was only prevented by its becoming a belligerent. England
did not accept these new rules, which were detrimental to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
as a naval power. The alliance isolated her, threatened to increase
the number of her enemies, and forced her to be cautious
in her dealings with neutral ships. War with the Baltic powers
would have ruined her, for since the American revolt she was
dependent on these countries for timber and other naval stores.
Happily, Catherine was by no means inclined to quarrel with
her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE QUARREL WITH HOLLAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_166" id="TOPIC_166"></a>The Dutch complained that England violated a treaty made
with them in 1674, which provided that either power should hold
all goods conveyed in the ships of the other, not being contraband,
as free from liability of seizure, and that either should be
free to trade with the enemies of the other. Many Dutch ships
were searched and their cargoes seized by English ships, in some
cases lawfully, because they were carrying contraband of war, in
others merely because they were carrying French goods or were
trading with our enemies. England contended that the treaty
of 1674 was superseded by the treaties of 1678 and 1716, which
provided that, when either power was attacked, the other should
come to its aid; and that, though the aid of the Dutch was not
demanded, they were at least bound to abstain from helping her
enemies. The Dutch, however, supplied the Americans with vast
quantities of naval and military stores, supplied naval stores also
to France and Spain, and allowed American privateers, and notably
Paul Jones, to refit and equip their ships and to sell their
prizes in Dutch ports. The British ambassador, Sir Joseph
Yorke, remonstrated strongly against these unfriendly acts on
the part of a nation in close alliance with his sovereign. He
could gain no satisfaction; for though the party of the stadholder
was anxious to keep on friendly terms, the pensionary
and the city of Amsterdam were violently opposed to England,
and the merchants generally were on their side. Late in 1779
a fleet of Dutch merchantmen, laden with timber and naval
stores for France, and sailing under the convoy of an admiral,
was met by an English squadron. The Dutch fired on the
boats sent to search their ships; the English returned the fire,
captured some of the ships, and brought them into Spithead.
Bitter complaints were made on both sides, and the Dutch, encouraged
by the declaration of the armed neutrality and the
influence of France and Prussia, showed no inclination to yield
to Yorke's remonstrances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>At last England had an opportunity of putting an end to
this course of unacknowledged hostility. In October, 1780, a
British frigate captured an American packet which was carrying
Laurens, lately president of congress, as ambassador to
Holland. He threw his papers overboard, but a British seaman
promptly went after them and brought them back. Among
them was a draft of a proposed treaty of commerce and amity
between Holland and the United States of America, signed by
the pensionary of Amsterdam and Lee, an American envoy, in
September, 1778, when Holland was bound by treaty to a close
alliance with Great Britain. England demanded a disavowal
of the treaty and the punishment of the pensionary. The states-general
voted to join the armed neutrality and, while disavowing
the treaty, did not proceed against the pensionary. England
declared war on December 20. The opposition maintained that
the government had behaved arrogantly and was actuated by
a desire for plunder, and that it was unjust to found a war on
a mere proposal emanating from the magistracy of a single city
and not confirmed by the states-general. Yet, if the conduct of
Holland is viewed as a whole, it will be found to justify the course
pursued by the government. England, then, in addition to the
war with her rebellious colonies, had to meet the forces of France,
Spain, and Holland. Nevertheless, the new accession to the
number of her foes was of no detriment to her, for the Dutch
were no longer powerful: it was better to have them open
enemies than treacherous friends; England's geographical position
enabled her to prevent their fleet from joining those of her
other enemies, and their commerce and colonies fell an easy
prey to her ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEFENCE OF GIBRALTAR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_167" id="TOPIC_167"></a>The recovery of Gibraltar was the principal object for which
Spain fought. During some negotiations for peace carried on
by unaccredited British agents in 1780, the Spanish minister,
Florida Blanca, avowed that for the sake of Gibraltar his master
would "break the family compact and every other engagement
with France". Germain was willing that the question should
be discussed, but North forbade the British agents to let the
word Gibraltar pass their lips, and Stormont declared that the
map of Spain's empire contained no equivalent for it, so the
negotiations were ineffectual.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The Spaniards made strenuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
efforts to take the fortress. On the night of June 6 they delivered
a sudden attack on the small squadron in the harbour
with fire-ships and a crowd of boats. They were foiled by the
valour of the British seamen who, under a heavy fire, grappled
the blazing ships and towed them ashore. Again Eliott found
himself in urgent need of supplies; food and ammunition alike
ran short, and early in 1781 it became evident that the place
would have to be surrendered unless it was speedily relieved.
Admiral Darby, then in command of the channel fleet, took out
a convoy with supplies. The French were occupied with their
own schemes of conquest, the Spanish fleet did not dare to
meet him, and the relief was accomplished on April 12. The
Spaniards then tried to reduce the place by a continuous
bombardment, and between the 10th of that month and the end
of June threw into it 75,000 shot and 25,000 shells. At first
Eliott replied even more fiercely; but, always careful of his
ammunition, he relaxed his fire on finding that the Spanish
bombardment did him small harm, for though the town was
virtually destroyed, the garrison lost only fifty-three killed and
260 wounded, and the fortifications were not seriously damaged.
While Spain was thus foiled in her principal effort, she completed
the reduction of West Florida, and her ships increased
the risks which attended the commerce of England. In August,
1780, a fleet of East and West Indiamen, convoyed by Captain
Moutray, was attacked by the combined fleets of France and
Spain, under Don Luis de C&oacute;rdova; fifty-five were taken and
brought into Cadiz harbour, at a loss to Great Britain of about
&pound;2,000,000, besides 1,800 soldiers who were on their way to
India.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_168" id="TOPIC_168"></a>Near home the enemies of England accomplished little.
In January about 800 French soldiers landed in Jersey and
surprised St. Heliers. The island was saved by Major Pierson
of the 95th, gallantly supported by such troops and militia as
he could gather at once. All the invaders were either killed
or taken prisoners, but Pierson fell at the moment of victory.
In July the combined fleets of France and Spain convoyed
14,000 troops on their way to Minorca, where they besieged
Fort St. Philip, which held out until the next year. They then
sailed, forty-nine ships of the line, into the mouth of the Channel
and cruised about on the look-out for convoys. Darby lay in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Torbay with thirty ships of the line, and they did not dare to
attack him; many of their ships were unseaworthy, and in
September the fleets for a second time retreated from the
Channel without accomplishing anything. Meanwhile the Dutch
were rendered incapable of acting with them. As Admiral
Hyde Parker, in command of a squadron, was convoying the
Baltic trade homeward on August 5, he met with a Dutch
squadron on the Dogger Bank convoying their trade to the
north. The two squadrons were nominally nearly equal, but
several of the English ships were in bad condition. There was
no man&oelig;uvring; both sides went at it in the old fashion, fighting
ship with ship all along the line. Both squadrons were
desperately hammered, and at last parted without definite result.
The Dutch loss in men was heavy; one of their best ships was
sunk and two others totally ruined. They became little more
than spectators of the war, and their possessions in the East,
Sumatra, Negapatam, and Trincomali, fell into the hands of the
English. Parker was furious with Sandwich for sending him
out with an insufficient and badly found force. George went
down to the Nore and visited his ship in the hope of appeasing
him, but the old admiral insisted on resigning his command, and
when pressed to remain, bluntly told the king that he wished
him "younger men and newer ships".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_169" id="TOPIC_169"></a>The temporary success of the opposition in the spring of
1780 showed the king that he could no longer reckon with
certainty on the support of the house of commons. On September
1 he suddenly dissolved the parliament elected in 1774,
and writs were issued for a new parliament to meet on October
31. The suddenness of the dissolution and the shortness of the
time allowed for the new elections were held to operate in
favour of the court. Nor did George neglect other means of
securing his authority, for he told North that the general election
cost at least twice as much as any other since his accession.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Rodney headed the poll for Westminster, but Fox secured the
second seat, defeating a ministerial candidate. Bristol, doubly
offended by Burke's efforts on behalf of Irish trade and catholic
relief, rejected him as its member, and he was provided with a
seat by Rockingham. Windsor refused to re-elect Keppel, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
it is asserted that George so far forgot his position as to go into
the shop of a silk-mercer of the borough, and say in his hurried
way: "The queen wants a gown, wants a gown. No Keppel!
No Keppel!"<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Among the new members were Sheridan, the
dramatist, and manager and part-owner of Drury lane theatre,
one of Fox's friends, who became famous as an orator, and
William Pitt, the second son of the great Chatham, who was
returned for Appleby on Sir James Lowther's nomination in
January, 1781, when he was in his twenty-second year. From
early youth Pitt showed signs of a remarkable genius which
was carefully cultivated by his father. Conscious of his ability,
he was reserved in manner, though he was warmly attached to
his intimate friends and talked freely with them. He lived
wholly for the service of his country, and took no part in the
pleasures or vices of his contemporaries, save that he habitually
drank far too much port wine. He joined the opposition, and
ranged himself with his father's old followers who acted under
Shelburne's leadership. On all questions of importance he
spoke with lofty eloquence, and his speeches, often splendid as
oratory, had the surpassing excellence of appealing to his hearers
by raising them to a higher level of thought and feeling than
that from which they had previously regarded the matter in
debate. His voice was rich, his words well chosen, and he was
singularly happy in sarcasm.</p>

<p>The king's influence was strong in the new parliament. Sir
Fletcher Norton, a bad-tempered and unprincipled man, who
had deeply offended him by his speech with reference to
the civil list in 1777, was again proposed as speaker by the
opposition, and was rejected by 203 votes to 134 in favour of
Cornwall, the ministerial candidate. The session opened languidly
and the attendance of the opposition was scanty. After
the Christmas recess the struggle with the government was carried
on with more energy. Little ground was gained. Burke's
bill for a reform of the civil list establishment was rejected by
233 to 190, and a like fate attended other efforts to destroy the
means by which parliament was subjected to corrupt influences.
Though the Dutch war was popular specially with the mercantile
class, which expected to benefit by it, both the nation and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
parliament were thoroughly weary of the American war, and
the opponents of it in the commons were strengthened by the
accession of Pitt who pronounced it "a most accursed, wicked,
barbarous, cruel, unnatural, unjust, and diabolical war".<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Yet
the news of successes in the south, of a mutiny of the Pennsylvania
troops in January, 1781, and of the distress and financial
difficulties of the Americans encouraged the government party.
Motions hostile to the war were feebly supported, and Fox's
jeers at British victories, and his declarations that the money
spent on the war was plundered from the nation, that the cause
of the Americans was "the cause of freedom, of the constitution,
and of whiggism, and that he had in its origin wished it success,"
excited justifiable indignation.</p>

<p>The most serious attack on the government was caused
by North's disgraceful manipulation of a loan of &pound;12,000,000.
Though more than three times the amount was offered, the
loan was arranged on terms so advantageous to the lenders that
the price of the new stock rose at once from 9 per cent. to 11
per cent. above par. The profits were calculated by Fox to
amount to &pound;900,000, and, as in 1763, the loan was distributed
among the supporters of the government, half of it, so it was
said, going to members of the house of commons, whether as
compensation for election expenses or generally as a means of
maintaining a corrupt influence. North's conduct was severely
reprehended in both chambers, and in two divisions on the
question in the commons the opposition voted 106 to 137 and
163 to 209. The life of the government depended on the
fortunes of the war in America; it was prolonged by gleams
of success; it was soon to be terminated by an overwhelming
disaster.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1780 the Americans were, perhaps, more
disheartened than at any other period of the war. They were,
as we shall see, losing in the south, and their hope of decisive
help from France was again disappointed. Congress continued
to issue paper money until its notes became of so little value that
ten paper dollars were exchanged for a cent; there was no money
and no credit, and Washington was forced to levy contributions
on the surrounding country to supply his army. The people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
generally were sick of the war. France was almost bankrupt;
even Vergennes was weary of American demands for help, and
suggested putting an end to the war by a long truce, the English
surrendering New York and keeping Georgia and South Carolina.
The idea was equally displeasing to the king and to the Americans.
It was not without reason that George believed that
"America was distressed to the greatest degree," and that if
his ministers persevered in the war they would wear down its
power of resistance.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MAJOR ANDR&Eacute;.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_170" id="TOPIC_170"></a>The depression of the Americans was deepened by the
treachery of Arnold. Conspicuous among their generals for
energy and dash, he was a vulgar-minded, irritable man, ruined
in fortune by his own extravagance, and with many enemies. He
had been treated badly by congress, and was finally maddened
by receiving a public reprimand ordered by a court-martial which
was held to examine charges affecting his probity. Washington
felt kindly towards him, and gave him the command of West
Point, a highland fortress which was the key of the line of the
Hudson. He had for some time contemplated deserting to the
British, and was in correspondence with Clinton, receiving replies
through Major Andr&eacute;, a gallant and popular young officer,
Clinton's adjutant-general, who wrote under the name of John
Anderson. Determined to avenge himself on congress, he
offered to betray West Point to the British. An attack was
to be made on September 25, and Arnold was to arrange
the American troops in such a way as to ensure its success.
Had the plot succeeded, the Americans would have lost communication
between the northern and southern provinces, and
would probably have been forced to give up the struggle. An
interview was necessary, and Andr&eacute; sailed up the river in the
<i>Vulture</i> sloop, and met Arnold secretly on the night of the 21st.
After the interview Arnold persuaded him to take shelter in a
house which, though he was not aware of it, stood within the
American lines, and gave him papers containing arrangements
for the attack. The next day Andr&eacute; could not find a boatman
to take him to the <i>Vulture</i>, and was forced to set out for New
York by land. He had a pass from Arnold made out for John
Anderson, he changed his uniform for a civilian dress, and passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the American lines in safety. On the 23rd he fell into the
hands of some American cattle-stealers; Arnold's papers were
found in his boots, and his captors handed him over to a militia
officer. Arnold received tidings of his capture and made his
escape on board the <i>Vulture</i>.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was tried by a court-martial consisting of fourteen
general officers, and was sentenced to death as a spy. Clinton
made every effort to obtain his pardon; Washington was inexorable,
and would not even grant Andr&eacute;'s request that he
might die a soldier's death. He was hanged on October 2, and
met his fate with dignity and courage. Inexpressibly sad as
his end was, he was not treated unjustly; he entered the enemy's
lines while attempting to assist their commander to betray his
post, he was within their lines in disguise, and he was taken
with papers upon him arranging the details of the betrayal.
Washington would have been held to have acted with generosity
if he had treated him as a prisoner of war, or even if he had
granted his pathetic request that he might be spared the ignominy
of the gallows. But an officer in command should not
allow any consideration to hinder him from doing what he believes
to be best for his army, provided it is not contrary to the
usages of civilised warfare. That Washington was guided by
this principle in sending Andr&eacute; to the gallows may fairly be
inferred from all we know of his character, and of the condition
of the American army at the time. His conduct needs no other
defence.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The traitor Arnold received &pound;6,300 from the British
government, and, it is painful to remember, a commission in the
army, which he entered with a brevet of brigadier-general.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RODNEY AT ST. EUSTATIUS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_171" id="TOPIC_171"></a>As soon as war was declared with the Dutch, orders were
sent to Rodney, who returned from America to the Antilles at
the end of 1780, to capture St. Eustatius. From a mass of
barren rock this Dutch island had suddenly become a place of
first-rate commercial importance. In order to supply our West
India planters with food for their slaves, parliament allowed
trade to be carried on there with the Americans. In St. Eustatius
the goods of all nations were bought and sold; and British
and French planters, American dealers and Dutch merchants
traded with one another as in a time of peace. English planters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and merchants also used it as a place of deposit, believing that
their goods would be safer there than in their own islands, which
were open to attacks from the French. The wealth of the island
was prodigious; the rents of the dwellings and warehouses
hastily constructed on it amounted to a million a year; it had,
as Burke said, risen from the waters like another Tyre to become
the mart of the world. Like the British island of Nassau during
the American civil war, it carried on along with legitimate commerce
a brisk contraband trade, and its merchants supplied
the Americans and French, their principal and most favoured
customers, with vast quantities of naval stores and ammunition.
It was practically undefended, and, together with its dependencies,
St. Martin and Saba, was surrendered to Rodney without
resistance on February 3, 1781. Over 150 vessels were taken in
the bay, besides a richly laden convoy of Dutch ships which
had lately put to sea. Rodney held that the island was a "nest
of villains," and that its "infamous and deceitful inhabitants"
owed their wealth to their support of the king's enemies by
contraband trading; they "deserved scourging," and he vowed
that they should get it. He confiscated all the property on the
island, private as well as public, save what belonged to the
French, who were open enemies. There was much truth in his
indictment, but his indiscriminate confiscation was monstrously
unjust.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_172" id="TOPIC_172"></a>The spoil of the island was estimated at &pound;4,000,000. The
king granted his rights over the booty to the captors. Rodney
was a poor man, and was greedy for wealth; he seized more
than the king could grant, or he could lawfully hold, for part of
the booty belonged to English merchants. His conduct was
severely and, though with some exaggeration, justly attacked by
Burke in parliament, and in after years he was harassed by suits
brought against him for unlawful spoliation. The booty sold
on the spot fetched far less than its value, and much that was
sent home fell into the hands of the French; for while Darby
was engaged in the relief of Gibraltar, a French squadron intercepted
the convoy which was bringing it to England, and carried
off several ships laden with spoil. The capture of the island
proved disastrous to England. A French fleet under Count de
Grasse was unfortunately allowed to leave Brest in March, for
England was embarrassed by naval conflicts all over the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Rodney expected its coming, and sent Sir Samuel Hood, as
fine a seaman as himself, and with a more single eye to the
king's service, to blockade Fort Royal, in Martinique, in order
to prevent four French ships which lay there from joining
Grasse. Hood wished to cruise to windward of the island,
which would have enabled him to force Grasse either to fight or
to give up his junction with the four ships. Rodney, who remained
at St. Eustatius looking after the loot, would not consent
to this, because, so Hood asserts, he was afraid that the ships
would slip out and attack the island.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Hood was forced to keep
to leeward; Grasse got between him and the island, was joined
by the ships, and so gained the superiority in force. Some
distant and indecisive fighting took place on April 29 and 30,
and finally Hood, being the inferior in force, and no longer having
any reason to risk his ships, sailed away from the enemy. The
French, though failing in an attack on St. Lucia, took Tobago, and,
what was of graver consequence, Grasse was enabled, apparently
through Rodney's anxiety concerning his booty, to maintain a
strong fleet in the West Indies, which before long helped to
bring victory within reach of the Americans. Grasse sailed for
the American coast in August. Rodney was obliged by ill-health
to return to England, and left Hood with only fourteen ships to
follow the French fleet, directing him to join Admiral Graves,
then in command in the American waters, in the neighbourhood
of the Chesapeake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORNWALLIS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_173" id="TOPIC_173"></a>As the British forces were divided between New York and
the southern provinces, it is obvious that the issue of the struggle
depended on the command of the sea. So long as the British
held the ocean way, the southern army would be able to receive
reinforcements and supplies, and could be aided by diversions,
the French alliance would be of little profit to the Americans,
and the long land journey, expensive and open to attacks, would
cut off the southern provinces from succours from the north.
The navy, as both Clinton and Washington saw, "had the
casting vote in the contest".<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> In July, 1780, soon after Clinton
returned to New York from South Carolina, a French squadron
brought nearly 6,000 men, commanded by Count de Rocham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>beau,
to Rhode Island. A few days after the arrival of
Rochambeau, the British fleet under Arbuthnot received reinforcements
which made it stronger than the French. Clinton
took measures for attacking the French by land and sea, but
was called back to New York by a movement on the part of
Washington, and a renewal of the plan was defeated by a quarrel
between him and Arbuthnot. The seven French ships remained
at Newport, blocked up by the British fleet, and though Washington
obtained some help from the land force, the greater part stayed
to guard the ships. Rodney should have attacked these ships as
soon as he arrived at New York in September. He probably
thought them of little importance, as they were thoroughly blockaded,
and did not care to risk his ships within reach of the French
batteries on the shore. The destruction of the squadron was
within his power and was well worth some risk. Great as he
was on sea, he did not understand the wide aspects of operations
of war. The presence of the French compelled the British to
keep a large force in New York and so hindered their operations
in the south.</p>

<p>Before Clinton left South Carolina, he issued a proclamation
which put an end to all hopes of neutrality; those who would
not fulfil the duties of loyal subjects would be held to be rebels.
This step caused many who would willingly have remained
neutral to join the revolutionists rather than fight against them.
The country soon became disturbed; the British were forced
to act with severity, and the Americans, both revolutionists and
loyalists, behaved with great cruelty towards their fellow-countrymen
of the opposite party.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Partisan leaders, among whom
Sumter and Marion were conspicuous, raised bands on their own
responsibility, and fought against the British, acting sometimes
independently and sometimes in conjunction with the forces of
congress. Cornwallis worked energetically at Charleston, enrolling
militia and providing for the administration, while Lord
Rawdon with the main body of the army kept the border at
Camden. Anxious to press on, Cornwallis desired Clinton to
send a force to Chesapeake bay, to divert the enemy while he
invaded North Carolina; but before he could advance further he
had to fight for the southern province. Gates was appointed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the supreme command in the south and was threatening Camden.
Cornwallis hastened thither with his staff and found Rawdon
with 700 sick and less than 2,000 fit for duty. The enemy was
greatly superior in number, without reckoning 1,000 men under
Sumter, who was cutting the British off from their supplies on
the west side of the Wateree river. Cornwallis met them on
August 16, and began the engagement with a vigorous attack
on the American left, formed by the Virginia and North Carolina
militia who, as the British advanced, firing and cheering,
threw down their arms and fled. The British victory was
complete; the Americans lost about 1,000 killed and wounded,
over 1,000 prisoners, and their artillery and stores; the British
casualties were 324. Two days later Colonel Tarleton smartly
surprised Sumter, and dispersed his band, retaking a convoy
which had fallen into his hands shortly before the battle of
Camden. The defeat of Gates's army drove the Americans
almost to despair.</p>

<p>Cornwallis was encouraged to pursue his grand plan of "conquest
from south to north". Clinton, though he did not approve
of his forward policy,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> sent General Leslie with 3,200 men to
Chesapeake bay to co-operate with him, and Cornwallis entered
North Carolina and advanced as far as Charlotte. In spite of his
brilliant victory he was beset by difficulties. The loyalists did
not give him the help which he expected; as soon as he left
South Carolina it broke into a ferment of disaffection, and his
troops were not suited for the guerilla warfare largely adopted
by the enemy, who were, Rawdon wrote, "mostly mounted
militia not to be overtaken by our infantry, nor to be safely
pursued in this strong country by our cavalry".<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In this as in
many other respects, the experiences of the war were repeated
in South Africa in our own day. Before Cornwallis left South
Carolina he detached a force of 800 militia and 100 regulars
under Major Ferguson to scour the border and keep the country
quiet in the rear of the army. They were met by a partisan
army of 3,000 men under different leaders at King's Mountain on
October 7; Ferguson was killed and all his men were either slain
or captured. So severe a loss, combined with the anxiety of Cornwallis
lest the important post called Ninety-six should be taken,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
put a stop to any further advance. Cornwallis fell back on
Winnsborough, and bade Leslie convey his force to Charleston,
which he was able to do as England had command of the sea, and
reinforce him. The safety of the border was his first care. No
sooner had Tarleton checked the inroads of Marion in the east
than he was summoned westwards to protect Ninety-six from
Sumter. He engaged Sumter's force at Blackstock on November
20, and claimed to have defeated him. Tarleton was a dashing
cavalry officer, given to overrating his own achievements. His
troops were few and weary, and at best he escaped defeat; but
Sumter's band dispersed, for its leader was wounded and disabled
for a while from further action.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF THE COWPENS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_174" id="TOPIC_174"></a>In December Greene, a general of far greater ability than
Gates, took the chief command in the south. Cornwallis found
the enemy on both his flanks. On the east Marion, then in
common with Sumter holding a commission from congress,
Henry Lee, and Greene himself endangered his communications
with the coast, and penetrated as far as Georgetown, and on
the west another division under Morgan threatened Ninety-six.
Disaffection was spreading rapidly through the province. Believing
that his one chance of conquering from south to north
lay in pushing forward, he determined to march into North
Carolina. Leslie joined him in January, 1781, and Clinton sent
Arnold and Phillips with a large force to take Leslie's place in
Virginia. On setting out for North Carolina, Cornwallis detached
Tarleton to deal with Morgan. He brought him to bay
at the Cowpens, near King's Mountain, on the 17th. Tarleton's
force, numbering about 1,100, was slightly superior to that of
the enemy, but he engaged while his men were weary after a
hard night-march. Some of his troops behaved badly; he was
utterly defeated, and lost nearly 800 men. This defeat was a
severe blow to Cornwallis, for it deprived him of the best part
of his light troops, which were specially necessary for his march
through a wooded and thinly populated country where much
foraging had to be done. He determined to advance, hoping
to get between Greene and Virginia, and force him to fight before
he received reinforcements. He burnt his superfluous baggage
and crossed the Catawba river. The two divisions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
American army retreated hastily through North Carolina, succeeded
in forming a junction, and crossed the Dan into Virginia
before the British could come up with them. Having thus
cleared the province of the revolutionary troops, Cornwallis
encamped at Hillsborough, and on February 20 summoned the
loyalists to join him. Some were coming in when, on the 23rd,
Greene, who had received reinforcements, recrossed the Dan.
Any further loyalist movement was stopped by an act of revolting
barbarity; 200 loyalists were caught by Lee's horse on their
way to the British quarters; they made no resistance and asked
for quarter, but were butchered by their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_175" id="TOPIC_175"></a>Cornwallis, finding it difficult to support his troops and being
anxious to encourage the loyalists by showing his superiority in
the field, accepted Greene's offer of battle at Guilford courthouse
on March 15. His force scarcely numbered 2,000, while
the enemy, regulars and militia, were 4,300 strong. The battle
was begun by the British left, consisting of the 22nd and 23rd
regiments, supported by grenadiers and guards, which charged
and routed the first line of the enemy with the bayonet. The
second line, formed by Virginians, stood steady and was not
driven back without a severe struggle; so too the First Maryland
regiment, in the third line, repulsed the first attack upon
it with heavy loss. The Second Marylanders fell back before
a battalion of guards, who pressed heedlessly after them and
were suddenly engaged by the American dragoons. The guards
fought fiercely, but were broken. For a moment things looked
awkward. Then the enemy was checked by the British artillery
and the guards were rallied by their brigadier O'Hara, who,
though severely wounded, was still able to do good service.
The British fought magnificently and won a brilliant victory.
Yet it was dearly bought, for the loss of over 500 rank and
file, a full third of his infantry, left Cornwallis powerless.
His little army was in need of supplies and he marched to
Wilmington, where stores brought by sea were laid up for
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORNWALLIS ADVANCES INTO VIRGINIA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_176" id="TOPIC_176"></a>Being too weak to do anything further without reinforcements,
he decided to leave the Carolinas, effect a junction with
Arnold in Virginia, and attempt the conquest of that province,
reckoning that success there would check disaffection in
South Carolina and ultimately tend to the conquest of North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> He wished Clinton to prosecute the war in Virginia
with all the strength at his command, even at the expense of
giving up New York. Clinton, however, was throughout opposed
to his forward policy; he would have had him attempt
nothing beyond the power of the force which he left with him,
"the defence of South, and most probably the reduction of
North, Carolina," and he did not intend the troops sent to
Virginia to engage in "solid" operations, which he judged to be
inadvisable until he should himself take the field. The king
and the cabinet approved Cornwallis's line of action.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> He advanced
into Virginia on his own responsibility. This step led
to unfriendly relations between the two commanders, and after
the war was the subject of a bitter controversy between them.
Cornwallis effected a junction with Arnold's army on May 20,
and in command of over 5,000 troops overran the province,
Lafayette, with a far inferior force, retreating before him. Meantime
Rawdon struggled gallantly, though unsuccessfully, against
Greene in South Carolina. He defeated Greene at Hobskirk
hill on April 25, but was forced to retire from Camden. The
loyalists saw that the British could not protect them; the whole
province was disaffected, and post after post was taken by
Greene, Lee, Sumter, Marion, and other generals. At last, after
Rawdon's return to England on account of ill-health, a hard-fought
battle at Eutaw springs on September 8, which both
sides claimed as a victory, so weakened the British force that it
remained in and about Charleston until it was withdrawn at the
end of the war.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_177" id="TOPIC_177"></a>To return to the spring of the year, Cornwallis's invasion
of Virginia and the destruction of property there seemed likely
to bring the war to a successful issue. Washington's army
was in grievous want of supplies, the American marine was
annihilated, their finances were in a ruinous state, and their
resources generally almost exhausted. Powerful co-operation
with Cornwallis on the part of Clinton was urgently needed.
The issue of the struggle depended on the power of Great
Britain to prevent a French fleet and army from undertaking a
joint enterprise with the Americans. At this critical juncture
England lost the superiority at sea. In May, Washington and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Rochambeau agreed that, as soon as Grasse brought his fleet
over, they would join forces, and either attack New York or,
perhaps, march into Virginia, as circumstances might direct.
Clinton discovered their design, would not spare any troops
from New York, and in June called on Cornwallis to send him
part of the force under his command, and ordered him to take
up a defensive position. Cornwallis retired down the James
river to Portsmouth. Clinton withdrew his demand for troops
and directed him to fortify a station on the Yorktown peninsula
as a port for ships. He would there be able to take up a defensive
position secured by access to the sea. Cornwallis concentrated
all his forces, about 7,000 men, and fortified Yorktown
and Gloucester. On July 6 Rochambeau, in expectation of the
arrival of Grasse's fleet, brought his troops from Rhode Island
(p. 219) and joined Washington at White Plains. It was agreed
between Grasse and Washington that the united army, 4,000
French and 2,000 Americans, should march into Virginia and
act in co-operation with the French fleet. Clinton, however,
deceived by fictitious letters, written by Washington and designed
to be intercepted, believed that it would attack New
York, and remained quietly there while it marched half through
New Jersey. Not until September 2 did he discover that it
was on its way to join in a combined attack on Cornwallis. On
the 5th it reached the head of Chesapeake bay.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAPITULATION OF CORNWALLIS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_178" id="TOPIC_178"></a>By that time the inferiority of the British fleet rendered
Cornwallis's situation extremely perilous. When Hood with the
fourteen ships of the line left by Rodney (p. 218) arrived off Cape
Henry on August 25, Graves was not there to meet him; he
sailed to Sandy Hook and joined him. The fleet, nineteen ships
of the line, sailed under Graves to Chesapeake bay, and found
that during Hood's absence Grasse had entered the bay with
twenty-eight ships of the line. Grasse at once stood out to sea,
for he was anxious to secure a junction with the squadron from
Newport, under Count de Barras, which Rodney had failed to
attack in the previous September. Graves, who should have
caught these ships instead of aiming at the main fleet, engaged
him on September 5, handled his fleet badly, and got his ships
knocked about. While he remained uselessly at sea the squadron
of Barras slipped into the bay. On the 14th the British
fleet returned to New York to refit, and Cornwallis was left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
without succour. Lafayette with a large army of French and
Americans was already blocking the neck of the peninsula.
Clinton attempted a perfectly useless diversion in Connecticut
under Arnold. Washington's army joined Lafayette on the
18th, and Cornwallis was soon besieged by a force of over
16,000 men. On October 19 he was forced to capitulate. Of the
garrison which surrendered at Yorktown and Gloucester, 6,950
men, only 4,017 remained fit for duty. On the day of the surrender,
naval reinforcements having arrived at New York and
the fleet at last being refitted, Clinton sailed with 7,000 troops
to the relief of Cornwallis. They found that they were too late
and returned to New York.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_179" id="TOPIC_179"></a>With this disaster the war in America virtually ended. Cornwallis
in his attempt to recover the southern provinces showed
a vigour and capacity which might, perhaps, have brought
matters to a different issue if he had held the chief command.
But his means were inadequate to meet the wastage caused by
battle and sickness; he found the loyalists a broken reed, and
his troops not well suited to the kind of warfare in which they
were engaged. "Had Lord Cornwallis staid in Carolina, as I
had ordered him," wrote Clinton, "and I had even assembled
my forces at New York, and remained there with my arms
across without affront, negative victory would have insured
American Dependence."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> "Arms across" seems indeed to have
been Clinton's favourite attitude.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Cornwallis's advance into
Virginia was certainly a risky movement, but it was a choice of
evils and did not in itself entail disaster. Clinton reckoned, not
without reason, that the Americans were too exhausted to prolong
the struggle; he was in favour of desultory operations on
the Chesapeake, against Baltimore and Philadelphia, with the view
of gaining loyalist support, and of waiting until he had received
reinforcements large enough to enable him to undertake a "solid"
campaign in Virginia, without leaving New York insufficiently
defended. Cornwallis believed that the best chance of success
lay in securing a firm hold on Virginia. Germain, who still
persisted in directing operations in America from London, considered
Cornwallis's plan more promising than that of Clinton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
He treated Cornwallis as though he had an entirely independent
command, with the result that serious misunderstandings arose
between Cornwallis and Clinton, the commander-in-chief, which
hindered their co-operation; and while he approved of the plan
adopted by Cornwallis he did not discountenance Clinton's proposals,
with the result that neither course of action was vigorously
pursued. It was by Clinton's order that Cornwallis retired to
the York peninsula, where his safety depended on the continued
command of the sea; the choice of Yorktown as his post was
his own. It was not a good choice; but he had little reason to
expect that he would have to hold it against an overwhelming
force of French and Americans, with a French fleet in command
of the sea. Clinton should not have been misled by Washington's
simple trick into allowing the combined force to advance
beyond his reach on its way to crush Cornwallis's army.</p>

<p>The true cause of the catastrophe, however, lay in naval
mismanagement. The mistaken policy of employing the British
fleet in various and distant enterprises instead of off the ports
of the enemy enabled Grasse to sail from Brest unopposed.
Rodney let slip a grand opportunity of baulking his plans off
Fort Royal, and sent, perhaps was forced to send, Hood after
him to America with an insufficient fleet. Partly through accident
and partly through an error of judgment, Graves missed
his junction with Hood. Grasse was consequently allowed
quietly to enter Chesapeake bay, and Graves afterwards failed
to use his ships to the best advantage. The loss of the command
at sea was fatal to Cornwallis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MINISTRY LOSES GROUND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_180" id="TOPIC_180"></a>Tidings of the disaster reached London on November 25,
two days before the meeting of parliament. On receiving them
North's habitual calmness broke down; he threw up his arms
as though he were shot, and repeatedly exclaimed, "O God! it is
all over!" The king's fortitude was unshaken, and he showed
no sign of agitation, save that, in acknowledging Germain's
letter informing him of the surrender, he omitted to note the
exact moment of his writing, as his custom was. The speech
from the throne at the opening of parliament, while acknowledging
disaster, contained no hint of giving way. Parliament
for a while upheld the ministers, and the address was carried in
the lords by 75 to 31, and in the commons by 218 to 129. Fox
and Burke threatened the ministers with impeachment and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
scaffold; and Pitt condemned their policy in speeches not less
effective for being more moderate in tone. North announced
that the war would no longer be carried on with a design of
conquest, but only for the possession of posts on the coast which
would be useful in the war with France and Spain. Crowded
meetings in London and Westminster condemned the government.
It was evident that there was dissension in the cabinet;
North was anxious for an acknowledgment of American independence,
Germain declared that he would never agree to it. By Christmas
the government lost many supporters in parliament.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_181" id="TOPIC_181"></a>Its position was further weakened by continued ill-success in
war. The Marquis de Bouill&eacute; retook St. Eustatius on October
25. Grasse returned to Martinique, and in January, 1782, the
two commanders landed a force on St. Kitts and besieged the
garrison. Hood followed Grasse with twenty-two ships, out-man&oelig;uvred
him brilliantly, beat him off on the 26th, and held
his station against a fleet of thirty-three ships of the line until
February 14, when, as he was unable to prevent the fall of the
island, he sailed away. The capture of St. Kitts and Nevis
reduced the British possessions in the West Indies to Jamaica,
Antigua, and Barbadoes. A joint attack on Jamaica was
planned by France and Spain. Rodney, however, again arrived
at the Antilles with twelve ships, was joined by Hood, and, as
we shall see in the next chapter, restored the British flag to its
proper place at sea. Nearer home, Kempenfeldt, the admiral
whose tragic end is famous in Cowper's verse, dealt the enemy a
severe blow. He was sent, in December, 1781, with only twelve
ships to intercept a French fleet consisting, as the admiralty
knew, or ought to have known, of seventeen ships with a
convoy bound for the West Indies. Kempenfeldt took at least
twenty of the convoy with troops and stores, but, overmatched
as he was, he was forced to let the fleet sail on. It was dispersed
by a storm shortly afterwards, and many of the ships
returned home. The loss of this convoy seriously crippled the
French in the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In the Mediterranean, the garrison
of St. Philips, in Minorca, which had been besieged since August
by a French and Spanish army, was forced to surrender on
February 5, after being reduced by sickness and war from 2,692<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to 600 men fit for duty, and eighty years after its conquest the
island was lost to England.</p>

<p>During the recess the ministers, convinced of the folly of
prolonging the war, arranged to go on without Germain.
Carleton succeeded Clinton at New York, and Germain was
succeeded as third secretary of state by the insignificant Welbore
Ellis, and was created Viscount Sackville, much to the wrath
of the whig peers, who tried in vain to obtain a vote that the
presence of a cashiered officer was derogatory to the dignity of
their house. The opposition gathered strength. A powerful
attack by Fox on the administration of the navy failed by
twenty-two votes, a motion by Conway for putting an end to
the American war only by one, and a like motion was carried a
few days later by a majority of nineteen. The government then
introduced a bill to enable the king to make peace, and North
sent envoys to Paris to sound Franklin as to terms. It was
evident that the end was near, and the new government was
eagerly discussed. Pitt, though acting with the opposition, took
a somewhat independent line, and announced in the house that
he would not accept a subordinate office. This from a young
member not then twenty-three excited some amazement, but
his assumption soon proved to be well founded. On March 11
George sent the chancellor, Thurlow, to negotiate with Rockingham,
but would not accept his terms. Three days later the
government escaped a vote of want of confidence only by nine
votes, and on the 20th North announced the resignation of the
ministry. George was in great distress, and talked of retiring
to Hanover, for life would be unendurable to him if he fell into
the hands of the Rockingham party.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SECOND ROCKINGHAM MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_182" id="TOPIC_182"></a>The two parties in the opposition, though acting together
against the government, held widely different views. The
Rockinghams aimed at a homogeneous ministry; they represented
the aristocratic whig faction, were the enemies of prerogative,
and were strong advocates of American independence.
Shelburne, like his old chief, Chatham, was opposed to government
by party, held that the king should have an interest in the
government, and so far "be his own minister," and like Chatham
had been hostile to American independence.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> For political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
reasons, then, George was drawn to Shelburne, while personally
he despised Rockingham and hated Fox. He invited Shelburne
first, and then Gower, to form a ministry. Both declined.
Shelburne could not afford to split with the Rockinghams;
he knew that they could not stand without him, and he advised
the king to send for Rockingham. George would not see
Rockingham himself, and negotiated with him through Shelburne
on the basis of freedom as regards men and measures,
and as to the acknowledgment of American independence.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Rockingham formed his cabinet on the 24th. He took the
treasury. Shelburne was secretary for home, Irish, and colonial
affairs; Fox for foreign affairs, the third secretaryship being
abolished; Keppel, who was created a viscount, first lord of the
admiralty; Richmond, master-general of the ordnance; Lord
John Cavendish, chancellor of the exchequer; Camden, president
of the council; Grafton, privy seal; Conway, commander-in-chief;
Dunning, who was created Baron Ashburton, chancellor
of the duchy of Lancaster. To please the king Thurlow was
retained as chancellor. Pitt was offered, and declined, a subordinate
office. Burke was treated by his aristocratic friends as
unworthy of cabinet office, and was made paymaster of the
forces.</p>

<p>The king was defeated. His system of personal government
through ministers supported by his influence in parliament
received its death-blow from the ill-success of the
American war. Before long he adopted a better system; he
found a prime minister who could command the confidence of
the nation, and he yielded himself, not always willingly, to his
guidance. Meanwhile the whigs were victorious. How long
they were to remain victors is yet to be seen. George was
resolute, skilful in intrigue, and by that time well versed in
politics. He was aided by the jealousies and mistakes of his
opponents. Even in their hour of triumph they found that he
gained an advantage over them. The cabinet was divided; its
new members belonged half to the Rockingham and half to the
Shelburne party, while Thurlow was the king's trusted friend.
Rockingham acted unwisely in accepting office offered to him
in a way which showed that he was not to have the king's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
confidence. Though he was prime minister, George gave his
apparent confidence to another member of the cabinet. Shelburne
was not unreasonably believed to be ready to make himself
useful to the king with an eye to his own advancement. The
seeds of discord and distrust were at once sown among the new
ministers. Even while the ministry was in process of formation
Fox sharply remarked to Shelburne that he perceived that it
"was to consist of two parts&mdash;one belonging to the king, the
other to the public".<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>THE ROUT OF THE WHIGS.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_183" id="TOPIC_183"></a>The new ministers at once attacked the sources from which
the crown derived its corrupt influence over parliament. They
carried bills preventing contractors from sitting in parliament
and depriving revenue officers of the franchise. As these
officers, who were dependent on the ministers of the crown,
numbered according to one computation nearly 40,000, and to
another 60,000, out of an electorate of about 300,000, their
disfranchisement was an important step towards freedom of
election. A message to parliament recommending economy
was extorted from the king as an introduction to a plan of
economical reform which was brought forward by Burke. It
was not so drastic as his earlier plan, for the king acting in
the cabinet through Shelburne and Thurlow objected to many
of the proposed retrenchments. Nevertheless, in spite of mutilations,
the bill, which became law, effected a saving of &pound;72,000
a year, chiefly by abolishing useless offices. The act also again
provided for the payment of arrears of the civil list, amounting
this time to &pound;296,000. Burke nobly continued his work by a
bill for the reform of his own office, preventing the paymaster
from gaining the enormous profits appropriated by nearly all
his predecessors. Another declaration in favour of freedom of
election was made by the commons, for they at last accepted
Wilkes's annual motion for expunging from their journals the
resolution of February, 1769, declaring him incapable of re-election.
The corrupt influence of the crown would, Pitt declared,
be checked most effectually by a reform of parliament. Acting
on his own account, he proposed an inquiry into the state of
the representation, without bringing forward any scheme of
reform. He pointed out that some boroughs were in the hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of the treasury, that others had no actual existence, and that
many were merely the property of purchasers, the naw&aacute;b of
Arcot, for example, returning seven or eight members. His
motion, though supported by Fox, was rejected by 161 to 141.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IRISH INDEPENDENCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_184" id="TOPIC_184"></a>Most memorable of the changes effected during the Rockingham
administration is the establishment of the legislative independence
of Ireland. When Carlisle went over as viceroy in
December, 1780, he was instructed that the government would
not oppose the demand for a <i>habeas corpus</i> act, but that he
was to prevent parliament from declaring for legislative independence,
or for a limitation of the perpetual mutiny act which
kept the army beyond its control. The Irish parliament for a
while steadily supported the government. The small party in
opposition included Flood, who, after holding a lucrative office
for six years, found himself unable to influence the government,
adopted a hostile line, and was dismissed, and, above all, Grattan
who had become leader of the party after Flood took office.
But the force which was to enlist parliament on the national
side was outside its walls. The volunteers grew in strength,
and reviews of large bodies of them were held during the
summer of 1781. They remained loyal, and when in September
the fleets of France and Spain threatened the coast of Munster,
they eagerly prepared to meet the enemy. At the same time the
impending success of the American revolution encouraged them
to demand independence for their own country, and as they
were nearly 100,000 armed and disciplined men, while less than
5,000 regular troops were left in Ireland, their voice could not
be disregarded. It soon made itself heard. On the invitation
of Charlemont's regiment a meeting of delegates from the
Ulster volunteers assembled in the church of Dungannon on
February 15, 1782. They passed resolutions condemning the
claim of the British parliament to legislate for Ireland, and the
control which, in accordance with Poyning's act, the privy
councils of England and Ireland exercised over Irish legislation,
and they demanded the limitation of the mutiny act, and
the independence of the judges.</p>

<p>Before the Irish parliament met after the Easter recess the
Rockingham ministry came into office; Carlisle was abruptly
removed, and the Duke of Portland was appointed to succeed
him. Rockingham, Fox, and Burke were anxious to satisfy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Ireland, but the ministry seems not to have determined its
exact line of policy. An attempt was made to embarrass the
ministers by Eden, Carlisle's chief secretary, apparently in
revenge for their discourteous treatment of Carlisle. Without
consultation with them, he proposed the repeal of the act of
9 George I. which asserted the right of the king and parliament
of Great Britain to legislate for Ireland. Fox opposed
the motion and it was withdrawn. The next day, April 9, the
ministers brought a royal message to parliament recommending
to its consideration means of satisfying Irish discontent. The
spirit manifested in the Dungannon meeting overcame the
resistance of the Irish parliament, and the nation was united
in its demands. Rockingham and Fox tried in vain to persuade
Grattan to give them time for consideration.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> On the 16th he
moved an address to the king in the Irish parliament asserting
independence, and it was carried unanimously. The ministers,
misled by Portland, believed that the Irish demands might be
modified, and proposed negotiation. Grattan refused, and they
yielded everything. On May 17 resolutions, afterwards followed
by statutes, were carried without division in both houses, conceding
legislative independence to Ireland, restoring the appellate
jurisdiction of the Irish house of lords, and limiting the
mutiny act. Ireland thus became almost an independent state.
It remained connected with Great Britain by the tie of the
crown, it had no executive dependent on its parliament, and
its legislation was subject to a ministerial veto. The revolution
of 1782, pressed on by Grattan, set up relations between the
two kingdoms which were anomalous and fraught with danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE "BATTLE OF THE SAINTS".</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_185" id="TOPIC_185"></a>Negotiations for peace were in progress, but the war still
went on, and its last great events were glorious. The navy was
far stronger than in 1778; the dockyards were busy during the
war, and the number of ships was much larger. Improvements
of various kinds were adopted; ships were coppered, the rapidity
and accuracy of their fire was increased by new inventions, and
carronades&mdash;light guns with a large bore mounted on the upper
deck, for use at close quarters&mdash;not yet adopted by the French,
were added to their armament. The discipline and ardour of
the <i>personnel</i> of the navy reached a high pitch. The British
sailor was keen to fight the Frenchman, and 93,168 seamen and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
marines are entered as borne during the present year. We left
the French and Spanish fleets in the West Indies preparing to
conquer Jamaica (p. 227). Grasse was at Fort Royal, and was
to join the Spaniards on the coast of San Domingo, and Rodney,
whose fleet was raised by his junction with Hood and the arrival
of reinforcements to thirty-seven ships of the line, lay on the
watch at St. Lucia. On April 8 the French stood out to sea,
and the next day Rodney found them off Dominica. An
indecisive action took place in which, owing to baffling calms,
only the British van was engaged. Grasse then beat to windward
between Dominica and the Iles des Saintes, but in consequence
of various accidents made little way. The British followed him,
and early on the 12th Sir Charles Douglas, the captain of the
fleet, awakened Rodney with the stirring tidings that "God had
given him the enemy on the lee-bow".</p>

<p>The English fleet was numerically the stronger, but the
French had finer ships and heavier batteries. The action began
about 7.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> At first it seemed likely to be as indecisive as
usual, the two fleets passing each other on opposite tacks and
cannonading, the French being to windward. As they sailed
slowly with a light breeze, and at a short distance from each
other, the British guns and especially the carronades were highly
effective, for the enemy's ships were crowded with soldiers for
the attack on Jamaica. Before long the battle took a form
which rendered it memorable in the annals of naval warfare,
for Rodney, without previous design, practised the man&oelig;uvre
known as breaking the enemy's line, and by that means was
enabled to bring the engagement to a decisive issue, such as he
hoped for in the battle of April 17, 1780. This man&oelig;uvre,
afterwards deliberately adopted with triumphant success by
Howe, Nelson, and other great captains, though often practised
in the naval battles between the English and the Dutch in the
seventeenth century,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> had fallen into complete oblivion, so firmly
did admirals believe in the necessity of keeping their line of
battle. By cutting through the enemy's line an admiral could
concentrate his attack on any portion of it which could least
easily receive help from the rest, and could throw the line into
confusion; the ships to the rear of the point of penetration
would be stopped, massed up, and might be caught together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
while those ahead pursued their course. This mode of attack
was worked out by a landsman, Clerk of Eldin, and though his
<i>Essay</i> was not fully printed until 1782, parts of it were privately
circulated in 1780.</p>

<p>As Rodney's flagship, the <i>Formidable</i> (98), which was half
way down the British line, was coming up with the <i>Glorieux</i>
(74), the fourth from Grasse's flagship, the <i>Ville de Paris</i>
(104), a slight change in the wind opened a gap between the
<i>Glorieux</i> and the ship next astern of her. Douglas urged
Rodney to steer through the gap. He refused, then yielded;
and as the <i>Formidable</i>, firing right and left from every gun at
the ships on either side of her, passed round the stern of the
<i>Glorieux</i>, and within pistol-shot of her, the French <i>canonniers</i>
could be seen throwing down their sponges and handspikes and
running below to escape the storm of shot which she poured
upon them. This time Rodney's captains were quick to understand
what he was at. The next five ships followed the <i>Formidable</i>,
and like her engaged on the windward side of the
enemy. Almost at the same time the ship sixth astern of her
also cut the enemy's line, passing through a gap abreast of
her. The French line was thus cut into three divisions, and
its central portion, consisting of five ships, was thrown together
and exposed to a deadly attack. By noon the enemy was
scattered in various groups, the English, who had gained the
wind, attacking at will and without any order. Grasse fought
his ship, the splendid offering of the city of Paris to its king,
with conspicuous gallantry, and the slaughter on board her
was awful. At last, about 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, he hauled down the flag
of France with his own hands, and surrendered himself to Hood
on the <i>Barfleur</i> (90). Rodney then stopped the fight. Four
other prizes were taken. Twenty more, Hood declared, might
have been taken if Rodney had followed up his victory. He
certainly lost a fine opportunity, probably because disease and
suffering had robbed him of some of his former vigour. As it
was, the "Battle of the Saints" saved Jamaica from invasion,
seriously damaged the French fleet, and shed glory on the navy
of Britain.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_186" id="TOPIC_186"></a>The concluding scenes of the siege of Gibraltar were not
less glorious. Vast preparations were made to take the fortress,
which in September was besieged on the land side by nearly
40,000 men, under the Duke de Crillon. The combined fleets,
forty-nine ships of the line, lay at Algeciras, and ten floating batteries
were constructed which, it was believed, could neither be
sunk nor burned. The garrison consisted of 7,000 men fit for
duty. Lord Howe, who on the change of ministry was appointed
to command the channel fleet, sailed to its relief on the 11th with
thirty-four ships of the line and many store-ships and transports.
On the 8th, when the enemy's works were not completed, Eliott
opened fire upon them and did them much damage by using
red-hot balls. During the next four days the enemy replied by
a terrific bombardment from their heavy ordnance and gunboats.
Early on the 13th a general attack was made by land-batteries
and sea-batteries, and a perpetual fire was poured upon the
fortress from over 300 pieces of the heaviest artillery. Eliott
directed his red-hot shot chiefly against the battering ships,
and at last during the night two of them caught fire. In the
confusion which ensued Captain Curtis, commanding a small
naval brigade, brought out his gunboats and completed the
enemy's discomfiture. Nine of the battering-ships blew up,
and the tenth was burnt by Curtis's boats. Some 1,500 of the
enemy perished, and 400 were saved from death by the British
seamen. After the failure of their great attempt, the enemy could
only hope to reduce the place by blockade. Howe's fleet had a
troublesome voyage, and did not come in sight until October 11.
He effected the relief of the garrison with admirable skill. As
he repassed the straits the combined fleet followed him, and on
the 20th engaged him at a distance, but he brought his fleet off
with little damage. The siege was raised on February 6, 1783,
when the war had ceased. Eliott, to whom the successful issue
of the defence, one of the finest feats of the British arms, was
principally due, was created Baron Heathfield.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAR IN INDIA AND INDIAN WATERS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_187" id="TOPIC_187"></a>In India the outbreak of war with France encouraged the
Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s, who dominated the country from Mysore to the
Ganges, in the hope of expelling the British, by acting in conjunction
with Haidar Al&iacute;. Hastings found that a French agent
was intriguing with them, and took prompt measures against
them. An expedition from Bombay failed miserably, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Colonel Goddard, who was sent by Hastings from Bengal,
captured Ahmad&aacute;b&aacute;d, and drove Sindhia over the Narbad&aacute;.
His fortress, Gwalior, was stormed by Major Popham in August,
1780. Nevertheless, the war strained Hastings's resources.
His difficulties were terribly increased by the invasion of the
Karnatic. Haidar and his son, Tip&uacute;, practically took the
English by surprise, overran the country with an army of some
75,000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry, instructed by 400 Frenchmen;
defeated the Madras troops, captured Arcot, and threatened
Madras. Sir Eyre Coote, who had come out to conduct the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;
war, was despatched to Madras, and in 1781 negotiations
were opened with Sindhia, and his former possessions were restored
to him. Peace was made with the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; confederacy
in May, 1782, by the treaty of Salb&aacute;i, which was ratified seven
months later. While Coote was forcing Haidar to raise the siege
of various British fortresses in January, 1781, a French fleet
appeared at Pondicherry. Haidar called upon it to help him,
for his own fleet had been destroyed by Admiral Hughes; but
Coote prevented the French from obtaining supplies, and they
sailed away without effecting anything. He gained a splendid
victory over Haidar at Porto Novo on July 1, met him with
doubtful success at Pollil&uacute;r, completely routed him at Sholinghar,
and, in January, 1782, though suffering from serious illness,
skilfully relieved Vellore.</p>

<p>Hughes had already taken the Dutch settlements, Negapatam
and Trincomali, when in February a French fleet appeared
off Madras to protect them. It was commanded by M. de
Suffren, an admiral of remarkable ability. Suffren sailed from
France in March, 1781. He fell on an English squadron, on
its way to seize the Dutch colony at the Cape, in the neutral
water of Porto Praya harbour in the Cape de Verde islands.
The fight was indecisive, but he arrived first at the Cape and
prevented the projected attack. His fleet was superior to that
of Hughes, whose principal object was to prevent him from gaining
a port as a place of supply and for landing troops. Hughes
fought four indecisive battles with him, and was unable either
to prevent the French from acting with Haidar, or from taking
Cuddalore, which gave them a good naval and military station,
or from reducing Trincomali. In this long and famous naval
duel Hughes, though a capable and gallant captain, showed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
himself far inferior to Suffren in strategical and tactical skill.
The French admiral, however, was constantly thwarted by the
misconduct of his subordinates, while the English captains
gave Hughes loyal support.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Coote carried on the war with
vigour, but his victory over Haidar and his French allies at
Arni was rendered fruitless by his lack of cavalry and supplies.
Haidar died in December, leaving a message bidding his son
make peace with the English, which Tip&uacute; did not obey. Coote
died in April, 1783. The peace with the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s enabled
the English to invade Tip&uacute;'s country on the Malabar side, where
they met with some success and one signal disaster. Meanwhile
Coote's successor, Stuart, was attacking the French in
Cuddalore. A fifth indecisive battle with Suffren on June 20
compelled Hughes to withdraw his fleet to Madras to refit.
Stuart's army, weakened by disease and in sore need of supplies,
was saved from probable disaster by the news of the treaty
of Versailles. Deprived of his French allies, Tip&uacute; was at last,
March 11, 1784, persuaded by Lord Macartney, the governor
of Madras, to make peace. By this treaty, which Macartney
made against the commands of Hastings, both parties surrendered
their conquests. A renewal of war was certain, for Tip&uacute;'s
arrogance was unabated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FOX AND SHELBURNE QUARREL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_188" id="TOPIC_188"></a>Although the government carried some highly beneficial
measures it was not free from the usual whig failings. Led
astray by party spirit, the ministers sent Admiral Pigot, a
mere nonentity, to supersede Rodney. Scarcely had they done
so when the news of Rodney's victory reached them. A messenger
was at once despatched to stop Pigot, but it was too late.
Rodney was created a baron, a rank which some thought unequal
to his deserts. While the ministers virtuously curtailed
the expenditure of the civil list, they burdened the country with
pensions of &pound;4,000 a year to Dunning and &pound;3,200 to Barr&eacute;, both
members of Shelburne's party. And they quarrelled amongst
themselves. That was the inevitable result of the existence of
two parties in the cabinet. Between Shelburne and Fox there
was much ill-feeling, which came to a head over the negotiations
for peace. Until the independence of the American colonies
was acknowledged, negotiations with them belonged to Shel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>burne's
department. The arrangement of a peace with foreign
enemies was Fox's business, and he would also be responsible
for negotiations with the Americans as soon as the colonies were
recognised as forming an independent state. In addition to the
difficulties naturally arising from this division of responsibility,
the two secretaries differed on policy. Fox desired an immediate
recognition of American independence, in the hope of
detaching the Americans from the French alliance, and so putting
England in a better position for dealing with her other enemies;
Shelburne agreed with the king that the acknowledgment should
be a condition of a joint treaty with France and America, for
England would then have a claim to receive some return for it.</p>

<p>Shelburne with, it is said,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> the consent of the cabinet, sent
one Oswald to Paris to open informal negotiations with Franklin.
Oswald, who was wholly unfit for diplomatic work, favourably
received Franklin's monstrous proposition that England should
cede Canada to the Americans, though they had been driven
out of the country, and the Canadians themselves desired to
remain attached to England. He gave Shelburne a paper
containing this proposition. Shelburne, who would certainly
not have assented to it, treated the paper as confidential and
did not show it to his colleagues. The cabinet agreed that
Oswald should return to treat with Franklin, and that Thomas
Grenville, the second son of George Grenville, who was nominated
by Fox, should negotiate with Vergennes. Rodney's
victory gave the ministers ground for believing that, if they
could separate America from France, they would be in a good
position to resist French demands; and they therefore instructed
Grenville to propose to Vergennes that England should acknowledge
American independence directly, and not through France.
This Fox held gave him the whole conduct of the negotiations.
As, however, Franklin was anxious not to lose so pliant a
negotiator as Oswald, the cabinet agreed that Oswald should
continue to confer with him. On June 4, Grenville complained
to Fox that the separate negotiation between Oswald and
Franklin rendered it impossible for him to make any progress,
and further told him that he had learned from Oswald that
Shelburne had seen the paper containing Franklin's proposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
with respect to Canada. Fox was indignant, for he considered
that Shelburne was carrying on a clandestine negotiation, and
that the concealment of the Canada paper was a proof of his
duplicity. On the 30th he proposed in the cabinet that the
independence of America should be acknowledged without a
treaty, which would have given him the entire charge of the
negotiations. He was outvoted and declared that he would
resign office. In this matter Shelburne does not appear to have
been guilty of intrigue. The two secretaries mistrusted and
were jealous of one another, and Fox was too ready to believe
that Shelburne was secretly working in league with the king to
counteract his negotiations, which was not the case. In concealing
the Canada paper from his colleagues, Shelburne behaved
with characteristic lack of openness, but as Franklin's proposition
was informal and required no answer, the matter was trivial, and
did not warrant the indignation which was expressed by Fox
and his friends.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SHELBURNE MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_189" id="TOPIC_189"></a>On July 1, the day after Fox declared his intention to
resign, Rockingham died. His death delivered George from
the domination of the whigs. He at once bade Shelburne propose
a plan for a ministry. The Rockingham party in the
cabinet objected, declaring that they had a right to advise the
king as to his choice, and pressed him to send for Portland,
whose position as a whig magnate constituted his chief claim to
office. George refused to yield to their dictation. Fox would
not serve with Shelburne and resigned the seals. He was followed
by only one member of the cabinet, Lord John Cavendish,
by Portland, Burke, Sheridan, and a few more. Richmond,
Keppel, and the rest of the party remained in office. Shelburne
took the treasury, Pitt became chancellor of the exchequer, and
Thomas Townshend succeeded Shelburne, and Lord Grantham
Fox, as secretaries of state. Barr&eacute; was made paymaster of the
forces, and Lord Temple, afterwards Marquis of Buckingham,
the eldest son of George Grenville, lord-lieutenant of Ireland.
Fox was disappointed to find that so few followed him. Distrusting
Shelburne as he did, he could not do otherwise than
resign rather than serve with him. As, however, the new ministry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
was a whig ministry, as Shelburne professed many of the Rockingham
principles, and as Pitt, who virtually had the leadership of
the lower house, was at that time a whig, he should have taken up
a neutral position, supporting the government when he approved
of its measures and opposing it when he disapproved of them.
He took another course; at once went into opposition, declared
the new ministers could not be bound either by promises or
honour, and prophesied&mdash;after events make his words worth
remembering&mdash;that they would soon "be joined by those men
whom the house had precipitated from their seats".<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Parliament
was prorogued on July 11.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_190" id="TOPIC_190"></a>The chief business before the new ministry was to arrange
terms of peace. England wished to free the Americans from
French influence and to establish good relations with them by
a separate negotiation. Vergennes hoped to delay the acknowledgment
of independence until a general peace, intending that
France should compensate Spain for her disappointment with
respect to Gibraltar by securing for her the sole navigation of
the Mississippi and that the United States should be enclosed
by the Alleghanies. The American commissioners found that
France regarded the success of the revolution, the result of her
own work, with jealousy, and wished to shut them out from
the Newfoundland fishery and from extension on the west and
north. On the other hand, England acknowledged American
independence on September 27, and showed herself inclined to
meet their demands in a friendly spirit. Accordingly, without
consulting the French ministers, they signed preliminaries of
peace on November 30, the treaty to be concluded when terms
were arranged between England and France. England acknowledged
the sovereignty of the United States; the Mississippi
was recognised as their boundary on the west, and on the north
a line passing through the great lakes; and they secured a right
to fish on the banks of Newfoundland and in the gulf of
St. Lawrence. The American revolution was accomplished.
Englishmen of all parties believed that the day of England's
greatness was over. Yet the separation, bitter and humiliating
as it was, taught her a lesson in colonial government which
has rendered her empire strong as well as vast, while in place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of discontented colonies with cramped energies, it laid the
foundation of a mighty power bound to her by bonds which
will grow in strength so long as the affairs of both Great Britain
and the United States are wisely directed. It was a happy
beginning of the relations between the two powers that it was
through England, and not through their foreign allies, that the
Americans obtained the gratification of their legitimate ambitions,
and that from the peace with the United States England
gained some advantage in treating with her continental foes.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_191" id="TOPIC_191"></a>The treaty did not protect the loyalists. Shelburne did
his best for them, but Franklin was bitter against them, and
his feelings were those of the victorious party generally. The
American commissioners would only agree that there should
be no further confiscations and prosecutions, and that congress
should recommend the several states to revise their laws concerning
them. These articles were nugatory. Nothing short
of a renewal of the war could have induced the Americans to
forego their revenge, and if the war had gone on longer, the
loyalists' fate would have been no better. Everywhere, with
the exception of South Carolina, they were treated with barbarity.
Some 60,000 persons left the country before Carleton
evacuated New York, taking refuge either in Great Britain or
her colonies. At least 25,000 of both sexes settled in the British
maritime provinces of North America, and helped to establish
the province of New Brunswick which received representative
institutions in 1784; 10,000 others, United Empire Loyalists as
they were afterwards called, in the valley of the St. Lawrence.
England did what she could for her unfortunate friends; liberal
grants of land were made to them, some had half-pay as military
officers, and between 1783 and 1790 &pound;3,112,455 was distributed
among them, besides &pound;25,785 granted in pensions.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Relief, however,
was slow in coming, and many, reduced from wealth to
penury, died in the utmost distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_192" id="TOPIC_192"></a>Preliminaries of peace with France and Spain were signed
on January 20, 1783, and were followed by the definitive treaty
of Versailles concluded on September 3. The war brought
France into financial difficulties, and for that reason England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
though forced to cede some of her conquests in the last war,
obtained as good terms as she had a right to expect. In the
West Indies she restored St. Lucia to France, ceded Tobago,
and received back Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Kitts,
Nevis, and Montserrat. In Africa Senegal and Goree went to
France, and Gambia and Fort St. James were guaranteed to
England. France received back her commercial establishments in
India; her right to participate in the Newfoundland fishery was
clearly defined; England ceded to her the islands of Miquelon
and St. Pierre in sovereignty, and the old stipulation for the demolition
of the fortifications of Dunkirk was given up. France
and Spain pressed the government to agree to some exchange
for Gibraltar. The king, Shelburne, and the majority of the
cabinet would have let it go if a sufficient compensation had
been offered; Richmond and Keppel objected to its cession
on any terms. The signature of the American preliminaries
strengthened the position of Great Britain and the question
was dropped.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Spain retained Minorca and West Florida, and
England ceded East Florida to her. On the other hand, Spain
restored by treaty Providence and the Bahama isles, which were
surrendered without bloodshed in 1782, and had already been
recovered not less easily by England; and she guaranteed the
right of the English to cut logwood in the bay of Honduras.
A truce with Holland led to a treaty providing for a mutual
restoration of conquests, with the exception of Negapatam which
was retained by England.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_193" id="TOPIC_193"></a>When parliament met on December 5, it was evident that the
terms of peace would be sharply criticised by both the parties
in opposition, the followers of North and of Fox. Shelburne
was disliked and distrusted by his colleagues, who considered
him secretive and inclined to act alone, and the government
soon showed signs of dissolution. Richmond retired from the
cabinet in January, 1783, though he kept his office; the next
day Keppel resigned the admiralty because he was dissatisfied
with the preliminaries, and Carlisle, the lord steward, also resigned
for the same reason. Shelburne was prevented by his
colleagues from making overtures to North, and Pitt, who stood
by him, tried to persuade Fox to re-enter the ministry. Fox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
asked if Shelburne would remain, and Pitt having answered that
he would, at once declined. On this Pitt closed the interview
with, it is said, the words: "I did not come here to betray
Lord Shelburne". From that time Pitt and Fox were political
enemies. The Duke of Rutland having succeeded Carlisle as
lord steward with a seat in the cabinet, Grafton declared that
Shelburne had no right to make an addition to the cabinet
without consulting its members, and that he was making himself
a "prime minister," and he too resigned the privy seal.
According to the whigs the cabinet was to dictate to the king
whom he should direct to form a cabinet, and was then to
control its own composition. Their constitutional ideas were
warped by their desire to perpetuate their own power.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_194" id="TOPIC_194"></a>The government was not in a case to speak with its enemies
in the gate. In the commons 140 members were known to be
supporters of Shelburne, 120 were followers of North, and 90
of Fox; the intentions of the rest were unknown or uncertain.
With this division of parties and with the government in a
state of dissolution, Fox, if he had exercised a little patience,
might soon have formed a strong and united whig party. He
chose another course, and, on February 14, formed an alliance
with North on the basis of "mutual good-will and confidence";
they agreed that enough had been done to reduce the influence
of the crown, that though the king should be treated with
respect, he should have only "the appearance of power," and
that on the question of parliamentary reform each should act as
he chose. This coalition decided the fate of the government.
The preliminaries of peace were discussed in parliament on the
17th, and almost every article was adversely criticised. In the
lords the government address was carried by 13; in the commons
it was rejected by 224 to 208. Fox was reproached for
his "unnatural junction" with North, and his answer showed
that he was prepared to act with him further than in that night's
debate. On the 21st a vote of censure on the terms of the
peace was carried by 207 to 190. The coalition was avowed.
Fox defended it with ability on the ground that the country
needed a broad and stable administration, and declared himself
a candidate for office in the future ministry. Pitt, in a speech
of great dignity, taunted "the self-made minister," contended
that the objections to the peace were simply an attack on Shel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>burne,
and in a fine peroration spoke of himself as caring more
for his own honour than for the emoluments of office. Shelburne
resigned on the 24th.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COALITION MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_195" id="TOPIC_195"></a>The coalition was triumphant. It was condemned by the
public, and the verdict has been endorsed by posterity. Though
it is true that North carried on the war with America only
to please the king, that was not then known, and his conduct
in that, and almost every important matter, was utterly opposed
to the principles which Fox professed. What ground was
there for mutual confidence? For eight years Fox had reviled
North with extraordinary bitterness. If his words were
just he had no business to ally himself with him. "My friendships,"
he said, with a Latin quotation, "are perpetual, my
enmities are not so," a good reason for reconciliation with a
private enemy; but political quarrels should be founded on
differences of principle. Fox's words illustrate his adherence
to the whig notion that the politics of the nation might be treated
by the members of a few great families as their personal concerns.
Of the two, North was at first more blamed than Fox,
for it seemed pusillanimous in him to forgive Fox's treatment,
but neither escaped censure. The king was furious. He had
no love for Shelburne, but he hated Fox, and determined if
possible to avoid falling into the hands of the coalition. He
offered the treasury to Pitt, who with admirable discernment
saw that his time was not yet come, and refused it. He tried
Gower; he tried to detach North from the coalition; he even
offered terms to the coalition; then again he pressed Pitt to
take the treasury, and failing in all these attempts, sought help
from Chatham's nephew, Thomas Pitt, and failed to obtain it.
From February 24 to April 2 the country was without an
organised government. George was almost in despair, talked
of retiring to Hanover, and spoke bitterly of the ingratitude
of North, whose past subservience to him had been largely rewarded.
At last he was forced to accept the coalition ministry,
to give Portland the treasury, and to submit to the exclusion of
Thurlow, who had been chancellor since 1778 in the ministries
of North, Rockingham, and Shelburne.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_196" id="TOPIC_196"></a>The new cabinet consisted of Portland, who was little more
than a figure-head; North and Fox, secretaries of state; Stormont,
president of the council; Carlisle, privy seal; Lord John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Cavendish, chancellor of the exchequer; and Keppel, first lord
of the admiralty. All except Stormont belonged to the party
of Fox, the dominant partner in the coalition. The great seal
was placed in commission. Burke again became paymaster,
and Sheridan was secretary to the treasury. George was determined
not to give his confidence to the ministers who had thus
thrust themselves upon him, and to get rid of them as soon as
possible. Fox applied himself assiduously to the duties of office,
as indeed he did during the Rockingham administration, and
strove in vain to overcome the king's dislike by deferential
behaviour. George's hostility was strengthened by the friendship
between Fox and the Prince of Wales. The prince's
habits were dissolute and extravagant; he was an undutiful
son, and the king a somewhat unforgiving father. He violently
espoused the cause of the coalition, and George is said to
have called the government "my son's ministry". It was
time to provide him with a separate establishment, and Fox
promised him that he would ask parliament for &pound;100,000 a
year. The majority of the cabinet thought the sum too large.
The king was of the same opinion, and did not wish his son to
be independent of all parental control. He therefore offered
him an allowance of &pound;50,000 from the civil list. Fox was
unwilling to disappoint the prince, and the dismissal of the
ministers seemed certain. They were saved by the prince's
acceptance of the king's offer, in addition to the revenues of the
duchy of Cornwall which amounted to &pound;12,000 a year; and
parliament had only to vote him &pound;60,000 for his debts and
present expenses. The question of parliamentary reform was
again brought forward by Pitt. As before, he urged that
reform would prevent the crown from again exercising corrupt
influence in parliament. He proposed as resolutions that
the number of county and metropolitan members should be
increased, suggesting an increase of at least a hundred, and
that for the future any borough which was found by a committee
of the house to be grossly corrupt should be disfranchised.
This, he believed, would gradually reduce the
number of members to what it then was, and would purify
elections. North opposed the motion, Fox spoke in favour of
it, though he wished that it had gone further. It was lost by
293 to 149. The public was no longer so eager for reform as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>

of parliament was lost by 121 to 56.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WARREN HASTINGS IN INDIA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_197" id="TOPIC_197"></a>Indian affairs demanded immediate legislation. The company's
charter was renewed in 1781; a new arrangement was
made as to its dividends and its payments to the state, and
its political transactions were placed more completely under
ministerial control. Two committees were also appointed by
the house of commons to inquire into its administration. Of
one of these Burke was the most active member, and Dundas,
then holding office under North, was chairman of the other. In
1782 Dundas moved resolutions condemning the company's
administration; the Rockingham ministry took the matter up,
and the house voted that Warren Hastings, the governor-general,
should be recalled. The directors agreed, but on
Rockingham's death the proprietors refused their assent.
North's regulating act of 1773 worked badly. From 1774 to
1780 Hastings was thwarted in council by three of the four
councillors sent out by the ministers, and specially by Francis,
the reputed author of the Junius letters, who opposed him with
extreme rancour. Hastings fought a duel with him in 1779
and wounded him; he returned to England, and Hastings
gained a majority in the council. The Madras council also
quarrelled with their governor, Lord Pigot; he was arrested
by their order and died in confinement. Other difficulties
arose from the independent action of the minor governments
of Bombay and Madras, and from the indefinite character of
the powers of the supreme court of judicature. Administrative
abuses existed, and the extreme financial difficulties caused by
the wars with the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s, Haidar Al&iacute;, and the French,
drove Hastings to adopt some high-handed measures. The
Rockingham whigs were adverse to him, and Burke, whose
generous emotions were roused by any tale of oppression,
applied himself to collecting evidence against him, which his
fervid imagination magnified and distorted.</p>

<p>Hastings guided the affairs of India through a period of
extreme danger; preserved the empire, brought order out of
anarchy in every branch of the administration, and won the
esteem and confidence of the subject people, the army, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
civil service. His task was not merely to govern well, but to
provide dividends out of revenue, and his work was criticised
by the company with reference to its pecuniary results as well
as its political wisdom. In Bengal he abolished Clive's mischievous
dual system, and administered the province through
English officials; he reformed the collection of the revenue,
and he effected large economies by reducing the enormous
pension of the naw&aacute;b, who under his new system was spared
the expenses of government, and by withholding the tribute
to the emperor, who was a mere puppet in the hands of the
Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s. While governor of Bengal he allied himself with
the Muhammadan states on the frontier, and specially with
Oudh, which he wished to make a barrier against Mar&aacute;th&aacute; invasion.
He took Allah&aacute;b&aacute;d and Kora from the emperor, or
rather from the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s, and made them over to Shuj&aacute;-ud-Daul&aacute;,
the waz&iacute;r of Oudh, and partly to raise money for the
company, and partly as a matter of policy he accepted the
waz&iacute;r's offer of forty lakhs of rupees for the loan of British
troops to help him conquer the Rohill&aacute;s, an Afghan tribe which
had lately settled in those districts and was intriguing with the
Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s. The conquest was carried out in Eastern fashion in
1774, and the waz&iacute;r's cruelties, which were grossly exaggerated,
were laid to Hastings's charge. The overthrow of the Rohill&aacute;s
was advantageous to the British rule; but though the council
at Calcutta thought the bargain highly profitable to the company,
the hiring out of British troops to serve as subsidiaries
to an Asiatic potentate was a deplorable mistake. Another
charge brought against Hastings concerned the execution of
Nanda-Kum&aacute;r (Nuncomar), a rascally Br&aacute;hman, who, after
Hastings was appointed governor-general, helped his opponents
in the council by bringing charges against him. Nanda-Kum&aacute;r
was hanged for a private forgery, after a patient trial
in the supreme court. His death was highly convenient to
Hastings, but there is no evidence that he had anything to do
with the prosecution or sentence.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FOX'S INDIA BILLS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_198" id="TOPIC_198"></a>During the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; war, a tributary chief, Chait Singh,
r&aacute;j&aacute; of Benares, neglected to perform the demands made upon
him, and showed a dangerously independent spirit. In 1781<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Hastings imposed an enormous fine upon him; he revolted and
was defeated, and his estates were confiscated and given to a
kinsman. Though the r&aacute;j&aacute;'s conduct was contumacious, Hastings
seems to have acted with undue severity. He was pressed
for money, and left the r&aacute;j&aacute; no choice between paying a very
large sum and losing his estates. Difficulties increased, and he
called on Asaf-ud-Daul&aacute;, then naw&aacute;b waz&iacute;r of Oudh, to pay his
heavy arrears of debt to the company. The begams, the mother
and widow of the late naw&aacute;b, had a vast treasure which should
have belonged to the state. Hastings was informed that these
powerful ladies were helping Chait Singh; it was necessary to
get money from the waz&iacute;r, and he bade him force the ladies to
give up their treasure. The resident at Lucknow brought up
some troops; the begams' palace at Faiz&aacute;b&aacute;d was blockaded,
and their eunuch-ministers imprisoned and maltreated until the
resident obtained enough to liquidate the waz&iacute;r's debt. The
waz&iacute;r threw the odium of this transaction on the English.
Hastings defended his conduct as just and politic. He was
not directly responsible for the severe measures adopted by the
waz&iacute;r, but it was certainly not a matter in which the British
governor-general and his officers should have taken any part.
His conduct in this matter as well as towards the Benares r&aacute;j&aacute;
was misrepresented and used against him in England.</p>

<p>The refusal of the proprietors to recall Hastings was highly
displeasing to the commons, and a petition from the company
for relief from some obligations imposed in 1781 gave occasion
to parliament again to interfere in its affairs. In April, 1783,
Dundas, who was then in opposition to the coalition ministry,
proposed a bill for the government of India. His plan was to
render the governor-general more independent of his council,
to subordinate more completely the inferior governments to the
government of Bengal, to change the uncertain tenure of the
zam&iacute;nd&aacute;rs into hereditary possession, to recall Hastings, and to
appoint some noble, like Cornwallis, as his successor. As the
government promised to bring in an India bill the next session,
he allowed his bill to drop. When parliament reassembled
in November, Fox brought in two bills, which were largely
prepared by Burke, one affecting the constitution of the company,
the other its administration in India. The first vested
the management of the territories, revenue, and commerce of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the company in seven commissioners, named in the bill, for
four years, with power to appoint and remove all officers of
the company. After that term Fox suggested that the crown
should nominate the commissioners, and meanwhile was to
appoint to vacancies. Commercial transactions were to be
managed by a subordinate board chosen by parliament from
among the larger proprietors. The second bill abolished all
monopolies in India, prohibited the acceptance of presents, and
gave native landlords an hereditary estate. The objections
urged against the first bill by the opposition, and chiefly by
Pitt, Grenville, and Dundas, were grounded on its violation of
the company's charter, and its tendency to vest the patronage
of India in the existing ministry. Fox ably defended the
bill, and Burke, in an eloquent speech, depicted, with much
exaggeration, the injustice which, he maintained, the millions of
India had suffered during Hastings's administration, and argued
that the delinquencies of the company justified the violation of
its charter.</p>

<p>It was, however, the political side of the bill which chiefly
roused opposition. All seven commissioners belonged to Fox's
party. For four years it vested in his nominees "all the patronage
of the East". Pitt declared that it created "a new and
enormous influence"; Grenville that "the treasures of India
like a flood would sweep away our liberties". Fox was accused
of making himself "King of Bengal," and a caricature represents
him as Carlo Khan entering Leadenhall street on an elephant
which has the face of North and is led by Burke. All
this was party exaggeration; the bill was a genuine attempt to
benefit the natives of India, and would not probably have had
any really serious consequences in England, though the control
of the Indian patronage for four years would have strengthened
Fox's party, and, if it had afterwards been vested in the crown,
would have given some opportunity for the exercise of corrupt
influence by ministers. The king was waiting for an opportunity
to get rid of the coalition ministry, and Thurlow and
Temple easily excited his jealousy for the prerogative by telling
him that the bill would deprive him of half his power and disable
him for the rest of his life. His influence in the commons
was diminished by recent legislation, and there the bill was
carried by two to one. Before the second reading in the lords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
he gave Temple a card authorising him to say that, whoever
voted for the bill "would be considered by him as an enemy".
This soon became known, and, on December 17, the commons
voted by 153 to 80 that it was now necessary to declare that to
report the king's opinion on any question pending in parliament
with a view to influence votes is a high crime and misdemeanour.
Nevertheless the king's unconstitutional move was successful;
the lords rejected the bill. The next night George ordered the
secretaries of state to send back their seals, for he would not
receive them personally, and the coalition ministry was dismissed.
Pitt at once accepted the offices of first lord of the
treasury and chancellor of the exchequer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT FORMS A MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_199" id="TOPIC_199"></a>He was then in his twenty-fifth year. Extraordinary difficulties
faced him: the opposition of a large majority of the
commons, led by Fox, a master of debate, and strong in men
of ability and experience, and the discredit attaching to the
king's unconstitutional action to which he owed his position.
He found it difficult to form a ministry, for few were willing
to join him in a struggle in which victory seemed hopeless.
Shelburne, his former leader, he would not invite, for he could
not endure his habitually enigmatic conduct. Temple, an instigator
and the agent of the king's action, became secretary of
state, but immediately resigned owing apparently to a personal
offence. The new cabinet consisted only of Lords Sydney
(Thomas Townshend) and Carmarthen, secretaries for the home
and foreign departments; Gower, president of the council;
Rutland, privy seal; Thurlow, chancellor; and Howe, first lord
of the admiralty; besides Pitt who alone among them sat in the
commons. Richmond again became master of the ordnance and
a little later re-entered the cabinet. Dundas was treasurer of the
navy. Pitt's acceptance of office was regarded by the opposition
as a "boyish freak"; his ministry was "a mince-pie administration
which would end with the Christmas holidays".<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_200" id="TOPIC_200"></a>Pitt had a majority of the commons against him; but in
those days the cabinet was not so wholly dependent on the
commons as it became after 1832.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Supported by the king and
the lords, Pitt determined to do battle with the majority in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
hope that he would overcome their opposition, discredit his
enemies, and win the confidence of the country before he
appealed to it. Fox should have urged an immediate dissolution.
If Pitt had tried to avoid it, he would have incurred
the odium of hesitating to accept the will of the nation. Fox,
however, used every effort to prevent a dissolution. The will
of the commons had been thwarted by the king's unconstitutional
interference, and he was determined to vindicate the
authority of the house. Besides, he had a substantial majority,
and though it might have been maintained by a general election,
he knew that his coalition with North was unpopular, and that
his India bill had aroused the hostility of some powerful
corporations which felt that their privileges were endangered
by his attack upon the company's charter. The affairs of India
were at once made a pretext for an address to the crown
deprecating a dissolution; the house was engaged upon them,
and a dissolution would frustrate its endeavours. The king
replied that he would not interfere with its work either by
dissolution or prorogation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S VICTORIOUS CONTEST.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_201" id="TOPIC_201"></a>The house reassembled after the Christmas recess on
January 12. Fox relying on the authority of Lord Somers,
one of the leading statesmen of the revolution, questioned the
right of the crown to dissolve parliament during the business
of a session; James II., he said, had done so and put an end to
his reign. His contention was unsound; the will of a house of
commons is not conclusive: the crown has a right to dissolve
in order to ascertain the will of the nation. Pitt replied that
he "would not compromise the royal prerogative or bargain it
away in the house of commons". He was in a minority of 193
to 232. On the 14th, he brought in his India bill, which proposed
to place the political concerns of the company under a
board of control in England to be appointed by the crown, and
to leave to the company its commerce and patronage. Fox
attacked it as incomplete, and it was negatived though only
by eight votes. A fierce struggle followed, a struggle, Dr.
Johnson called it, "between George the Third's sceptre and Mr.
Fox's tongue". Fox tried every means to force the ministers
to resign; he put forth all his wonderful powers of debate and
attacked Pitt with great bitterness; addresses to the crown and
resolutions hostile to the ministers were adopted, and the sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>plies
and the mutiny act were postponed. Through it all Pitt
exhibited wonderful courage, sagacity, and self-control. A body
of independent members proposed a compromise, and the king
reluctantly assented. Fox declared himself willing to work
with Pitt, but, determined to assert the authority of the house,
insisted that the ministers should resign before arrangements
were discussed. To this Pitt haughtily refused to assent.
George upheld him: during the late administration he would
not create any peers; on Pitt's recommendation he created
four, and almost daily sent his young minister encouraging
little notes. The lords too were on his side; they condemned
as unconstitutional a resolution of the commons suspending
certain statutory powers of the treasury, which was adopted in
order to embarrass the ministry, and sent an address to the
king assuring him of their support in the just exercise of the
prerogative.</p>

<p>Pitt won general admiration by granting the valuable sinecure
office of clerk of the pells to Barr&eacute; in exchange for the
pension secured to him by the whigs. His private means were
only &pound;300 a year, and, as such matters were then regarded, he
might have taken the office himself without scandal; but uncertain
as his position seemed to be, he preferred saving the
country &pound;3,200 a year to putting it into his own pocket. Feeling
outside the house ran strongly in his favour; addresses were sent
up thanking the king for dismissing the late ministry, and Pitt
was presented with the freedom of the city of London. As on
his return from the city on February 27 his carriage was being
drawn by workmen in triumph up St. James's street, it was
attacked opposite Brooks's, the meeting-place of Fox's party;
he was assaulted and escaped with difficulty into White's club.
Members of Brooks's were believed to be concerned in the outrage,
which increased Pitt's growing popularity. The opposition
began to waver. On March 1 a fresh address to the king for
the removal of the ministers was carried by only twelve votes.
George again refused his assent. Fox shrank from attempting
the extreme measure of refusing supplies; it would, indeed,
have been useless, for his suggestion that the house should pass
a mutiny bill for a brief period met with no encouragement.
He made one more effort; on the 8th he moved a representation
to the king, drawn up by Burke, which was carried only by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
one vote. The struggle was over; the next day the usual
mutiny bill passed without a division; the supplies were voted,
and on the 23rd Pitt saw that the time had come for a dissolution.
A difficulty suddenly arose, for the great seal was
stolen from Thurlow's house. A new one was promptly made,
and on the 25th parliament was dissolved.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_202" id="TOPIC_202"></a>Of his coalition with North, Fox said that it could be justified
only by success. For a second time he put his political
fate to the touch. He attempted to give absolute authority to
one branch of the legislature, to enable an existing house of
commons to restrain the constitutional exercise of the prerogative,
to prolong its own existence, and to hinder an appeal to
the will of the nation. Both moves were disastrous to him.
The coalition was condemned as unprincipled; whigs were
offended at his alliance with North, whom they held responsible
for the American war, tories by the alliance of North with the
opponent of prerogative. His attempt to hinder the expression
of the national will by a general election perplexed the whigs,
his attack on the prerogative disgusted the tories. His India
bill alarmed chartered bodies, and was held, unjustly it is true,
but with some show of reason, to be inspired by the wish to
perpetuate the power of the whig oligarchy through corrupt
influence. Feelings of personal loyalty and of admiration for
the youthful minister who dared to fight, and was able to win,
the king's battle against such tremendous odds, combined to
destroy the effect of George's unconstitutional proceeding and
to rouse enthusiasm for Pitt. The opposition candidates were
defeated in almost all the larger constituencies; 160 of them&mdash;"Fox's
martyrs" they were called&mdash;lost their seats. The
rout was complete; even Yorkshire, so long faithful to the great
houses, returned Pitt's friend, Wilberforce, the son of a banker.
One consolation they had. After an exciting struggle Fox
was re-elected for Westminster, though only as second member,
and, as we shall see, even this triumph was disputed. Fox's
conduct caused the overthrow of the whig party, and gave the
government into the hands of a minister whose high principles,
not less than his supreme ability, commanded and preserved the
confidence of the nation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS.</p>

<p class="center">(1760-1801.)</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_203" id="TOPIC_203"></a>The first forty-one years of the reign are marked by important
social and economic changes, some of which began earlier, and
some were not fully carried out till later. Though the cursory
review of them attempted in this chapter will extend beyond
the date which we have already reached, it seems time to say
something of such matters, and a look ahead will make the later
narrative more complete and intelligible. With the painful exception
of a deterioration in the condition of the poor, these
changes were for the better. Manners became more decent,
pity was more easily evoked by human suffering, and culture
more widely diffused. Moral improvement may be traced to a
revival of practical religion and to a general reaction from the
artificial cast of thought of earlier days, while as forces on the
same side may be reckoned the influence of the king and, in
a greater degree, that exercised by a number of distinguished
men such as Johnson and Burke. Ideas elaborated and propounded
by French philosophers shook the smug satisfaction of
the world in what was hard, shallow, and insincere, and combined
with the stress of a great war to complete the slow
progress of a change in English taste. After long hesitation
literature and art finally turned from unreality and convention,
and drew inspiration direct from nature. As regards material
progress, manufactures and commerce were enormously increased
by the use of mechanical inventions, and the productive power
of the soil by improvements in agriculture. The conditions
of industry changed and, as must ever be the case, industrial
revolution brought suffering on the poor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_204" id="TOPIC_204"></a>The highest class still formed a small and close society;
there was no doubt as to who belonged to it and no chance for
an outsider to push his way into it. The members of it were
so thoroughly acquainted with one another's doings that invitations
to dinner were often given only two days beforehand, and
with even shorter notice. They had enormous authority, both
political and social. Entirely independent of public opinion,
those of them who loved vice or frivolity indulged their tastes
without shame or measure. Gambling, the fashionable folly,
was carried to an extraordinary height, especially between 1772
and 1776. At Brooks's the stakes at quinze were not less than
&pound;50, and there was often &pound;10,000 on the table. Gamesters
exchanged their rich clothes for frieze coats, covered their lace
ruffles with leather cuffs, and shielded their eyes by high-crowned
hats with broad brims. Fox squandered &pound;140,000,
chiefly at play, by the time he was twenty-five, and his brother
Stephen lost &pound;20,000 at a sitting. Among the older gamesters
were Lord Masham, too poor for such folly, the wicked
Lowther, witty George Selwyn, and his associate, Lord March,
afterwards Duke of Queensberry, Fox's instructor in vice, the
"old Q." who in the next century as he sat in his favourite
place above the porch of his house in Piccadilly presented to
the passers-by the embodiment of the iniquities of an older
generation. Ladies were not less given to play than men.
Duchesses at Bath, the "paradise of doctors and gamesters,"
set an example which the vice-regal court at Dublin professed
to imitate by spending whole nights at unlimited half-guinea loo.</p>

<p>There was no redeeming side to this gambling; it was a
sordid struggle for money. At Brooks's in 1781 Fox, in partnership
with some allies, kept the bank at faro as a regular
business, one partner relieving another, and play going on continuously
night and day. As the dealer and the partners could
be seen at work through the open windows of the club, one can
scarcely wonder that Fox's faro-bank was a sore point with the
opposition. He won largely, then lost, and finally was &pound;30,000
"worse than nothing". Idlers in St. James's street were
amused by watching the Jews as they packed his clothes and
books and carted them off from his lodgings. The next year
the king was forced to make him a secretary of state. Though
gambling continued common, it became less extravagant and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
was more widely condemned. In 1796, when the war with
France was sobering people, some ladies of rank created a
scandal by keeping a faro-bank at their houses. Chief-justice
Kenyon threatened the pillory, and Gillray expressed and stimulated
public opinion by a caricature representing two of "Faro's
daughters" in that position. One of them, Lady Buckinghamshire,
and two of her associates, were fined the next year for
unlawful gaming. Fox and other gamesters of the wild time
supplemented the faro-bank by betting at Newmarket. It was
a notable period in the history of the turf, for many great men,
specially of the whig party, were eager and judicious breeders.
Such were the king's uncle, Cumberland, the breeder of Eclipse,
Grafton, Rockingham, Egremont, Richmond, and Sir Charles
Bunbury, whose horse Diomed won the first Derby race in
1780. The professional bookmaker was not yet, and racing,
though used for betting purposes, was free from some evils
which grew up later. The sport was popular, and in 1784 as
many as 500 plates were raced for annually.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXCESSIVE DRINKING.</i></div>

<p>Excessive drinking was common in society. Since the
Methuen treaty of 1703 port was the wine most drunk. A
genuine port cost about two shillings a bottle, but the wine was
largely adulterated on importation, and one stingy lord is said
to have recommended his guests to drink his port instead of a
more expensive wine by assuring them that he knew that it
was good as he made it himself.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Men would constantly drink
two bottles of port apiece at a sitting, and sometimes three and
even more, and would appear in parliament, in the theatre,
or in a drawing-room in a state of drunkenness. A treaty with
France in 1786 largely increased the consumption of French
wines, but this change, which favoured sobriety, was ended by
the war. Nevertheless, drunkenness was less general than
earlier in the century, and, except in the Prince of Wales's set,
seems to have decreased during the war with France. Duels
were frequent, and, though towards the end of our period they
were increasingly condemned by religious people, they were
approved of by society at large. For some time men of fashion
dressed in velvets and silks of various hues, but during the
American war Fox, once the most extravagant of "macaronis,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and his friends showed their political sympathies by carelessness
in dress, and their example was largely followed. Men's
dress, however, did not decline until about 1793 when the whigs
imitated the severity affected by the French republicans. Wigs
were discarded early in the reign, except by professional men,
and hair-powder began to fall out of fashion by the end of the
century. Then, too, ladies' dress became more simple, chiefly
because improvements in the textile manufactures provided
them with materials at once simple and pleasing.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary amusements of society, fashionable
people frequented public assemblies, of which those at Ranelagh
were longest in vogue. The company at Vauxhall was more
mixed. People of the shop-keeping and lower classes enjoyed
themselves in the numerous pleasure resorts about London,
such as Mary-le-bone gardens, Islington, and Sadler's Wells.
Theatres were well attended and the increase of public decency
is illustrated by the disappearance from the stage of the coarseness
of earlier times. It was the golden age of the drama; for
it saw the acting of Macklin and Garrick, of Mrs. Siddons, "the
tragic muse," and her brother John Kemble, of Mrs. Abington,
Miss Farren, "the comic muse," afterwards Countess of
Derby, and Mrs. Jordan. As dramatists Home, Foote, Colman,
and Cumberland deserve to be mentioned; and Goldsmith and
Sheridan wrote comedies which, while belonging to acting drama,
adorn English literature. Among less respectable amusements
bull-baiting was confined to the lowest class. An attempt to
render it illegal was defeated in parliament in 1800, chiefly
through the opposition of Windham. Cock-fighting, though
widely condemned, was practised even by gentlemen, chiefly
as a means of betting. Exhibitions of combats with swords
became extinct, and made way for the scarcely less dangerous
prize-fights of bruisers which from about 1788 became extremely
popular.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_205" id="TOPIC_205"></a>Foreign travel, which earlier was almost confined to the
"grand tour" made by rich young men as part of their education,
increased greatly before the revolutionary war, and
travelling in England became more general as the means of
communication were improved. In 1760 English roads were
little better than they were a century before, mere trackways,
which in parts were sloughs in winter and scored with deep ruts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
in summer. Travelling over them was slow and often dangerous.
The "flying-machine," or coach, between London and Sheffield
was fully three days on its journey. During the first fourteen
years of the reign 452 acts were passed for repairing roads, but
for some time little progress was made. Many and bitter are
the complaints made by Arthur Young, the eminent agriculturist,
of the roads on which he travelled in 1769-70. One
turnpike road was a bog with a few flints scattered on top,
another full of holes and deep ruts, while "of all the cursed
roads which ever disgraced this kingdom" that between Tilbury
and Billericay was, he says, the worst, and so narrow that when
he met a waggon, the waggoner had to crawl between the
wheels to come to help him lift his chaise over a hedge.
During the last quarter of the century a vast change was
effected; good roads became general, and coaches with springs
and otherwise well appointed ran between London and most
considerable towns, and between one large town and another.
From 1784 many of these coaches carried the mails, and letters
posted in Bath were delivered in London seventeen hours later.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POETRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_206" id="TOPIC_206"></a>The wider outlook acquired by travel contributed to an
increase of intellectual activity, and improved means of internal
communication assisted the dissemination of books. People
read more; many instructive books met with a large sale, and
circulating libraries were established in the larger towns. In
literature the period is marked by an advance in the transition
from artificiality of thought, and still more of expression, to what
was natural and spontaneous. Antiquity began to attract, and
romanticism gradually gained ground. Thomson, who led the
flight of poetry from the gilded house of bondage, wrote at an
earlier time than ours. For us the new feeling is illustrated
by the popularity of <i>Ossian</i>, Bishop Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, Gray's
romantic lyrics, and the pseudo-antique poems of Chatterton,
a Bristol lad who killed himself in 1770. Goldsmith's poetry
belongs to the old school, for he was a follower of Johnson, a
strenuous opponent of the new romanticism. The poetry of
Cowper, an ardent lover of nature, whose first volume appeared in
1781, though usually conventional in expression, is always sincere
and sometimes exquisite. Crabbe, a story-teller and preacher,
wrote some true poetry, along with much that is prosaic:
rarely moved by an inspiration drawn from nature to desert the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
conventional couplet, he nevertheless had something of the spirit
of the new movement. In 1783 the artist-poet Blake began to
write verse which is absolutely untrammelled by convention,
mystical, strange, and unequal. Three years later a volume by
Robert Burns, the national poet of Scotland, contained the outpouring
of a passionate soul in musical verse, and in 1798, two
years after his death, the victory of the romantic school was
secured by the publication of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> of Wordsworth
and Coleridge, though its triumph was not confirmed until a few
years later.</p>

<p>By 1760 Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett had established
the English novel, though Smollett's master-piece, <i>Humphrey
Clinker</i>, did not appear until 1771, the year of his death.
Fiction developed in various directions. In <i>The Vicar of
Wakefield</i> Goldsmith, in spite of his literary conservatism,
portrayed manners and character with a perfectly natural
grace, and with a delightful delicacy of touch. Laurence
Sterne, the humorous and indecent prebendary of York, illustrates
the prevalence of sensibility in contemporary society in
his <i>Tristram Shandy</i> and the <i>Sentimental Journey</i>. It is a
curious characteristic of the time that displays of emotion by
men and women alike were reckoned as proofs of genuine fineness
of feeling. Sterne's sentiment and discursiveness found
several feeble imitators. The taste for antiquity was strong in
Horace Walpole, and his admiration for "the gothick," expressed
in the pointed windows and sham battlements of his
house at Strawberry hill, inspired his romance, <i>The Castle of
Otranto</i> (1764), which began the romantic movement in fiction.
To this movement, destined to be adorned by the genius of
Scott, belong Beckford's <i>Vathek</i>, Clara Reeve's <i>Old English
Baron</i>, and the once widely popular tales of mystery of Mrs.
Radcliffe and "Monk" Lewis, as he was called after his best-known
romance (1795). The novel of manners was developed
by Fanny Burney's (Madame d'Arblay) <i>Evelina</i> (1778), founded
on acute observation, dealing almost wholly with every-day life,
replete with satire, and written with extraordinary freshness and
vivacity. <i>Castle Rackrent</i>, the first of Maria Edgeworth's Irish
tales, appeared in the last year of the century. Before its close,
too, Jane Austen was writing novels which as yet could find
no publisher, though in their faultless execution, their delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
humour, and their life-like representation of the society with
which their author was familiar they remain unrivalled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SERIOUS PROSE WORKS.</i></div>

<p>Of the writers of serious prose works, Johnson, as critic,
moralist and author, enjoyed until his death in 1784 a kind
of literary dictatorship. His greatest achievement, <i>The Lives
of the English Poets</i>, belongs to his later days. This delightful
work pronounces with unfaltering dogmatism judgments founded
on canons of criticism which were accepted in the then expiring
age of Augustan literature. His <i>Life</i> by his satellite Boswell
holds the first place among biographies as a triumph of portraiture.
The new interest in antiquity was fostered by the rise of
English historical writing. In the earliest years of the reign
Hume completed his <i>History of England</i>, which, though no
longer regarded as of scientific importance, is a fine example
of literary treatment as applied to history. A little later came
Robertson's works, more scholarly in their design, and written
in a philosophic spirit and in highly polished language. The
work of one historian of the time is great alike as a monument
of learning and of literary faculty. The first instalment of
Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> appeared in
1766, the last in 1788. The grandeur of its conception, the
orderly method of its construction, the learning it displays, and
the unflagging pomp with which the historian presents his
narrative, invest this book with a pre-eminence in English
historical literature which remains beyond dispute. Other
famous books of the time are Paley's theological works, Sir
William Blackstone's <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i>,
and Adam Smith's <i>Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations</i> (1776). Smith, while laying the foundations of political
economy as a distinct science, treated theories in relation
to actual facts; his book was at once accepted as a guide by
statesmen, and largely inspired Pitt's economic policy. As a
political writer Burke carried rhetoric to the sublimest heights
in his <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i> and some later works.
Lord Chesterfield's <i>Letters</i>, many of them belonging to the early
years of the reign, are admirable for their wit and elegance,
but lack the special quality of the inimitable <i>Letters</i> of Horace
Walpole, written on a countless number of topics, and treating
them in a manner which, though somewhat affected, is easy and
singularly appropriate to the writer's cast of mind. Of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Junius <i>Letters</i> enough has been said; they are political articles,
not parts of a correspondence. Lastly, it would be unbecoming
to omit here a notice, however cursory, of Walpole's valuable
though not always trustworthy historical <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_207" id="TOPIC_207"></a>The ecclesiastical architecture of the time was deplorable.
Towards the end of the century it was affected by the revolt
from classicism in literature; and a desire was manifested to
desert the corrupt following of classical models for Gothic art,
but it was unaccompanied by taste or knowledge, and the elder
Wyatt's sins of destruction at Salisbury and elsewhere have
made his name a by-word. In secular architecture things were
better; Chambers, the architect of Somerset House, Robert
Adam and his brothers, architects of the Adelphi buildings, and
the younger Wood at Bath have left us works of considerable
merit. In art, however, our period is chiefly memorable as that
of the development of the English school of painting. Sir Joshua
Reynolds, one of the great portrait painters of the world, was
in high repute in 1760, was the first president of the Royal
Academy, founded in 1768, and independently of his work did
much to raise the appreciation of art, for he was universally
respected. He started the famous literary club of which his
friends, Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, and other distinguished men,
were members. Scarcely inferior to Reynolds as a portrait-painter,
Gainsborough invested his subjects with wonderful
grace, and Romney, though not attaining to the height of
these two, may be reckoned with them as a master of his
art. Before the end of our period Hoppner and Lawrence
were working in London and Raeburn in Edinburgh. The
heavy debt which English landscape painting owes to Wilson,
who lived neglected, has been acknowledged since his death.
In that line Gainsborough was unsurpassed; he was wholly free
from classical tradition and, as in his portrait work, interpreted
nature as it presented itself to his own artistic sense. By 1800
Girtin had laid the foundation of genuine painting in water-colours,
and Turner was entering on his earlier style, working
under the influence of old masters. Humble life and animals
were depicted by Morland, who was true to nature and a fine
colourist. In the treatment of historical subjects classical tradition
long held an undisputed sway; and the chief claim of West,
once a fashionable artist, on our remembrance is that he broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
away from it in his best picture, "The Death of Wolfe," painted
in 1771, which represents his figures in the uniforms they wore
instead of dressed as Romans, a revolt which caused no small
stir.</p>

<p>Engraving on copper flourished, aided by the enterprise of
Boydell, and wood-engraving was brought to perfection by the
brothers Bewick. In sculpture, Flaxman, Nollekens, and Bacon
did first-rate work. Music alone of the arts really interested
the king. The public taste was stimulated by the establishment
of Handel commemoration concerts; the opera was well
attended, and church music was enriched by some distinguished
composers. People of the upper and middle classes cared far
more for art of all kinds than in the earlier half of the century:
the rich bought the works of old Italian and French masters;
exhibitions of art were thronged, and articles of <i>virtu</i> found a
ready sale.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_208" id="TOPIC_208"></a>During the earlier years of the reign much interest in natural
science was aroused, probably through French influence.
England soon came to the front in scientific investigation.
Among the principal contributors to this movement were
Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen, and Black, of latent heat;
Cavendish, the investigator of air and water; Sir William
Herschel, the astronomer, who spent most of his life in
England; Hutton, the father of British geological science; Sir
Joseph Banks, the naturalist; Hunter, the "founder of scientific
surgery"; and Jenner, who in 1798 announced the protective
power of vaccination against small-pox. <a name="TOPIC_209" id="TOPIC_209"></a>Science was aided by
voyages of discovery, some of them of the highest future
importance in the history of the world, and in the extension of
the British empire. Between 1764 and 1768 come Commodore
Byron's fruitless voyage round the world, and the discovery of
a large number of islands in the South Pacific by Captains
Wallis and Carteret. Cook's three great voyages were made
between 1768 and 1779. In the course of them he sailed round
New Zealand, explored the east coast of Australia and the new
Hebrides, discovered New Caledonia and the Sandwich islands,
and attempted to find a passage from the North Pacific round
the north of the American continent. In 1780 an expedition
under Captain Bligh, sent to transport bread-fruit trees from
Otaheite to the West Indies for acclimatisation, ended in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
famous mutiny on board his ship, the <i>Bounty</i>. To the last
years of the century belong the voyages of Bass and Flinders
in Australian waters. Meanwhile Mackenzie descended the
river which bears his name to the Arctic ocean, and in 1770
Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller, reached the sources of the
Blue Nile.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_210" id="TOPIC_210"></a>Between 1760 and 1801 the national Church, the proper instrument
of national reformation, was passing through a period of
transition. Its vitality was somewhat injured by its controversy
with the deists, and still more by the action of the state. It was
a powerful political engine and as such it was used by statesmen.
Convocations remained silenced, and Church preferments were
made to serve political ends and were regarded both by clergy
and laity as little more than desirable offices. Clergymen begged
bishoprics and deaneries of Newcastle with unblushing importunity,
sometimes even before the men they aspired to succeed
had breathed their last. Neither they, nor the ministers who
treated Church patronage as a means of strengthening their
party, were necessarily careless about religion. Newcastle and
Hardwicke, for example, were religious men, and the personal
piety of some preferment-seeking bishops is unquestioned. It
was a matter in which the Church was neither better nor worse
than the age. The ecclesiastical system was disorganised by
plurality and non-residence; the dignified clergy as a whole
were worldly minded, and the greater number of the rest were
wretchedly poor. The Church was roused to a sense of its duty
to society by methodism and evangelicalism, two movements
for a time closely connected, though after 1784 methodism became
a force outside the church. By 1760 the persecution to
which John Wesley and his fellow-workers had sometimes been
exposed was over, and methodism was gaining ground. It
very slightly touched aristocratic society, chiefly through the
efforts of the Countess of Huntingdon, who, in spite of her
quarrel with Wesley's party, must be regarded as one of the
leaders of the movement; its influence on the labouring class,
specially in large towns and in the mining districts, was strong,
and it gained a considerable hold on people of the middle class.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EVANGELICALS.</i></div>

<p>Within the Church rapid progress was made by the evangelical
movement. Many of the earlier evangelical clergy were
methodists, some workers with Wesley, others preachers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Lady Huntingdon's "connexion" before her secession in 1781.
During the last two decades of the century the evangelicals
became distinct from the methodists and formed an increasing
body inside the Church. Among its clerical chiefs were Romaine,
Venn, Cecil, and Newton of Olney, the spiritual guide
of many of its leading adherents; it owed much to Lord Dartmouth's
patronage, Cowper's poetry presented its doctrine in a
pleasing form, Hannah More furthered its cause by her writings,
and Wilberforce brought it into connexion with political life.
Only one of the avowed evangelical clergy, Isaac Milner, Dean
of Carlisle, received dignified preferment before 1800, for the
king was averse from "enthusiasm," and though Pitt's Church
appointments were eminently respectable, he does not seem to
have been guided in making them by any exalted consideration.
Whatever the failings of the evangelical party may have been,
it certainly exercised a strong and wholesome influence on the
national life, which was aided by the effects of the war with
France. Not only did the discipline of war sober the nation,
but it also extended the revolt against unreality which took
place in the domains of literature and art, to that of religion,
and brought people to accept a teaching which appealed more
strongly to the heart than that of the older school of clergy.
While most of the work of the evangelicals lies outside our
subject, the character of its influence on society may be gathered
from their efforts for the suppression of the slave trade; from
the stricter observance of Sunday which became general towards
the end of our period; from their plans for bettering the condition,
and their care for the education of the poor. The
institution of Sunday schools was largely due to Robert Raikes,
of Gloucester, who began his work in 1780. Six years later
some 200,000 children attended these schools, and in many
cases gained in them their only education. The work was
encouraged by the king and queen, and along with other efforts
for the education of the poor was helped forward by Hannah
More, Wilberforce, and other evangelicals.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_211" id="TOPIC_211"></a>Apart from any religious movement, many laymen, among
whom Burke holds a high place, strove to soften the hardness
and cruelty of the age. There was need of their efforts. The
criminal law was fearfully severe. Early in the reign as many as
160 crimes were capital felonies, and the number was constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
augmented. A theft of more than the value of twelve pence by
picking a pocket was punishable by death. This severity led
to an increase of crime. The injured would not prosecute,
juries would not convict on clear evidence, judges recommended
to mercy, and criminals were emboldened by the chances of
escape. The heavy punishments attached to light offences
tended to multiply serious crimes; for a thief who knew that
he might be hanged was tempted to commit murder rather
than be caught. Though only about a fifth of the capital
sentences were carried out, executions were terribly numerous,
especially between 1781 and 1787. In 1783, at two consecutive
executions, twenty persons were hanged together. Ninety-six
were hanged at the Old Bailey in ten months in 1785, and at
the Lent assizes of that year there were twenty-one capital sentences
at Kingston, twelve at Lincoln and sixteen at Gloucester,
and in each town nine persons were hanged. Executions were
popular spectacles; 80,000 persons are said to have been present
at one at Moorfields in 1767, and over 20,000 assembled at
Tyburn in 1773 to see a woman burnt&mdash;she was previously
strangled at the stake&mdash;for the murder of her husband. The
ghastly procession to Tyburn was stopped in 1783, and executions
were ordered to be carried out in front of the prison; and
in 1790 the burning of women was abolished. Otherwise, in spite
of Burke's efforts, the criminal law was not materially ameliorated
till the next century. The punishment of the pillory was one of
its worst abuses. When inflicted for some popular act, such as
libelling a minister, the offender was treated as a hero, but if a
man's crime outraged the moral sense of the mob, he was exposed
to horrible barbarity. Two men were pelted to death, in
1763 and 1780, on the pillory in London. After the second of
these murders Burke brought the matter before parliament; he
was supported by Sir Charles Bunbury, who quoted a similar
case at Bury, but the punishment was not abolished. Whipping
was constantly inflicted, not merely on men but on women, and
in public as well as privately. The poor were brutalised by
cruel and indecent punishments, and were far too much under
the power of magistrates, some of them vicious and ignorant
men, who had summary jurisdiction in a large number of
criminal cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRISONS AND POLICE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_212" id="TOPIC_212"></a>The prisons were horrible dens in which felons and debtors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
men and women, old and young, were crowded together. Many
of them had no water-supply and very little air; some had no
sewers, and where sewers existed they were generally choked
up. Great numbers died of gaol-fever and small-pox. In
about half the county gaols debtors had no allowance of bread.
Everywhere prisoners were exposed to extortion, and were
sometimes detained in gaol after acquittal for non-payment of
the gaolers' fees. Such was the state of things in 1773 when
John Howard began to inquire into the condition of the prisons.
He roused the attention of parliament and of the public to these
abuses, and by 1779 some of the more flagrant of them were
removed. He spent the remainder of his life in efforts to reform
the prisons, and accomplished much, though much still remained
to be done. After 1776 convicts could no more be transported
to America, and male convicts were kept in hulks on the
Thames and elsewhere. These hulks soon became overcrowded,
and in 1784 the old system of assigning convicts to
employers in different parts of the British dominions oversea
was again adopted. The evils of this system were recognised,
and it was decided to send criminals sentenced to transportation
to New South Wales. A government was established; Captain
Phillip, of the navy, was appointed governor, and in 1787 took
out the "first fleet" with convicts. He established a settlement
at Port Jackson, and founded a city which he called Sydney,
after the then secretary for home affairs. Such was the unworthy
beginning of the present magnificent colony of New
South Wales.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_213" id="TOPIC_213"></a>The population outgrew the police system. Riots were
frequent in times of scarcity or popular excitement, and often
could only be quelled by soldiers. Throughout the whole of
our period highwaymen infested the roads; in 1774 Horace
Walpole at Twickenham declared that it was scarcely safe to
venture out by day; Lady Hertford had been attacked on
Hounslow Heath at three in the afternoon. Some daring
robberies, two of them of mails, were effected in 1791. In
the earlier years of the reign smuggling was carried on with
amazing audacity, specially on the south and east coasts. It
was calculated that 40,000 persons were engaged in it by sea
and land, and that two-thirds of the tea and half the brandy
consumed in England paid no duty. Bands of armed smugglers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
rode up to London with their goods, and attempts to interfere
with their trade were fiercely and often successfully resisted.
Smuggling, however, was checked, as we shall see, by the wise
policy of Pitt. The weakness of the police caused an alarming
increase of crimes against property; footpads stopped carriages
even in Grosvenor Square and Piccadilly, and in 1792 the
streets are said on good authority to have been unsafe by
night. With the exception of a few Bow street officers and
some mounted patrols, the only police in London were parish
constables and the watchmen, many of them old and decrepit.
The magistracy of Middlesex had largely fallen into the hands of
men described by Burke as "the scum of the earth," who used
their office as a means of getting gain, and frightful abuses were
common.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> In 1792 parliament established stipendiary magistrates
appointed by the crown for the London police courts, and
a few police officers were attached to each court. This important
reform would have been more effective if a larger number of
police had been placed under the orders of the new magistrates,
for after that date the police of London and its immediate
neighbourhood consisted of not more than 2,044 watchmen and
patrols and 1,000 constables and other officers, of whom only
147 received pay and gave their whole time to police work.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_214" id="TOPIC_214"></a>The general belief that the trade of Great Britain would be
ruined by the loss of the American colonies was not justified.
Between 1783 and 1800 her foreign trade and manufactures
were developed at an extraordinary rate. The official value of
English exports in 1760 was &pound;14,694,970, and of imports
&pound;9,832,802; in 1783, of exports &pound;13,896,415, and of imports
&pound;11,651,281; in 1800 the exports of Great Britain were officially
valued at &pound;34,381,617, and the imports at &pound;28,257,781.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
Her foreign trade, which provided her with an extended
market, was maintained through her naval supremacy. Before
1780 the war with the colonies had little effect on her trade;
the declaration of the armed neutrality decreased its profits
by increasing risks and raising the rate of insurance, but does
not appear to have inflicted special injury on any particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
branch of it. The American shipping was destroyed and Dutch
commerce suffered severely. At the end of the war England
was far stronger by sea than she was before it began; her
manufactures, specially of iron and cotton, began to develop
rapidly, and she kept the American trade. During the revolutionary
war the French believed that they could reduce
England to impotence by ruining her commerce. They failed
to understand the consequences of her power at sea and the
firmness of the foundation on which her wealth rested. The
ports of France and her allies were blockaded; England may
be said to have carried the greatest part of the trade of Europe,
her manufactures flourished exceedingly, and foreign nations
could not afford to abstain from purchasing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LAISSEZ-FAIRE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_215" id="TOPIC_215"></a>Before entering on the expansion of manufactures and the
industrial revolution which accompanied it, a word may be said
as to the attitude of the state towards these changes. For
some two centuries it had been held that it was the duty of the
state to order trade with the object of increasing the wealth and
power of the nation, and a policy was followed of interference
with trade and its conditions by regulations, bounties, and restrictions,
which is called the mercantile system. To this policy
belong the navigation acts and the regulation of colonial trade
and manufactures for the benefit of the mother-country. The
American revolution dealt it a mortal blow. About the same
time Adam Smith's work led to the idea that national wealth
would increase if men were left to seek their own wealth without
interference. While trade outgrew the old regulations
which ordered its conditions, the system of state interference
became discredited, a new economic policy of non-interference,
called <i>laissez-faire</i>, took its place, and questions of trade, manufacture,
wages, and other conditions of labour were increasingly
left to settle themselves. This reversed the policy long and
successfully pursued by the whigs, who fostered trade as the
basis of national prosperity. The tories on the other hand held
that national prosperity was based on land, and desired to lighten
its burdens by taxing personal property, and we shall find Pitt
distributing his taxation widely and so as to fall mainly on the
moneyed class.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> <i>Laissez-faire</i> reached its full development in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the establishment of free trade; it has already been modified
in many respects, and may hereafter be subjected to further
modification to suit altered circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_216" id="TOPIC_216"></a>The expansion of trade during our period was due to
improved processes of manufacture and increased facilities of
transport, and in a far higher degree to the substitution of
machinery moved by the power of water or steam for manual
labour. The north, hitherto the most backward part of England,
became the chief seat of industrial life and commercial
enterprise. Wealth was increased, industry became more dependent
on capital, and changes were effected in its conditions
which for a time pressed heavily on the poor. In 1760 there
was no Black Country. Charcoal was employed in the manufacture
of hardware, and the Sussex iron works produced a
small quantity of pig-iron at a great cost. Fuel was giving out,
and England, rich in iron, imported over 49,000 tons of iron a
year from Russia and Sweden. The discovery that coal and coke
could be used for smelting was made about 1750, and in 1760 a
new era in the manufacture was ushered in by the foundation
of the Carron ironworks, which had blast furnaces for coal. The
improvements in Newcomen's steam engine, effected by Watt
between 1765 and 1782, facilitated smelting by coal by providing
the furnaces with a stronger blast. In 1783-4 Cort of
Gosport invented processes for converting pig-iron into malleable
by the use of coal, and for converting malleable iron into
bars by rollers, instead of sledge-hammers. Iron became cheap
and was used for purposes never dreamt of a few years before; the
first iron bridge crossed the Severn at Coalbrookdale in 1779.
By 1796 the use of charcoal had almost ceased, and the produce
of blast furnaces had risen from 68,300 tons in 1788 to
over 125,000 tons. Vast iron works were established in the
coal districts, which soon ceased to be agricultural. Among the
many other manufactures expanded by new processes was that
of pottery. In 1760 Staffordshire stoneware was rough and
badly glazed, and much ware was imported from France. A
few years later Wedgwood succeeded in producing a ware at
his works at Etruria which was superior to any brought from
abroad; it was largely used in England, and five-sixths of the
produce of his works was exported.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_217" id="TOPIC_217"></a>The increasing call for coal both for manufacture and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
fuel and the needs consequent on the growth of trade and the
expansion of agriculture were met by greater facilities of transport.
Roads, though they were gradually improved, could not
have answered the demands for the conveyance of the ever-increasing
bulk of heavy goods. A better method was found
in the introduction of canals by the third Duke of Bridgewater.
The canal between Worsley and Manchester, made by him
and his engineer, Brindley, and opened in 1761, enabled the
Manchester people to buy the duke's coal at 3&frac12;d. instead
of 7d. a cwt.; its extension to Runcorn reduced the cost of
carriage by water between Liverpool and Manchester from 12s.
to 6s. a ton, while by road it was 40s.; and the Grand Trunk canal
from Runcorn to the Trent brought the pottery of Etruria to
Liverpool and carried other goods at a quarter of the old cost
of transport. The success of these undertakings was so great
that people went wild about canal-making, and between 1790
and 1794 eighty-one canal acts were obtained, many of them,
of course, for superfluous projects.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_218" id="TOPIC_218"></a>The principal factor in the industrial revolution which began
during the period under review was the substitution of machinery
for hand labour in textile manufactures. In 1760 spinning and
weaving were domestic industries, carried on, that is, in the homes
of the workers. The women and children in farm-houses and
cottages spent their spare time in spinning. The implements
used in the cotton manufacture remained nearly as simple as
those of the Homeric age, save that weaving had been facilitated
by the use of the fly-shuttle. Since that invention the weaver
found it difficult to obtain enough yarn for his loom, until, about
1767, a weaver named Hargreaves invented the spinning-jenny
by which a child could work many spindles at once. Two years
later Arkwright, who introduced many inventions into the textile
manufacture, brought out a spinning machine worked by
water-power. His water-frame spun automatically and produced
a yarn strong enough for warp, so that for the first time
pure cotton goods were manufactured in England, for until then
the cotton weft was woven on a warp of linen. This machine
was improved on by Crompton's mule, a cross between the
jenny and the water-frame, which spun a finer yarn, and so
started the manufacture of muslin in England; it was invented
in 1775 and came into general use about ten years later. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
supply of cotton from India, the Bahamas, and later from the
southern states of America, was large, and the effect of the new
machinery on the manufacture can be gauged by the increase
in the import of cotton-wool from an average of 4,764,589 lbs.
between 1771 and 1775 to 56,010,732 lbs. in 1800. The new
labour-saving inventions were at first regarded with jealousy by
the workmen. Hargreaves had his house gutted and his loom
destroyed, and in 1799 a violent riot broke out about Blackburn;
Arkwright's works were burnt, and many machines in
the neighbourhood were broken to pieces. In and around
Lancashire, where the manufacture was chiefly carried on, the
carding and spinning of wool ceased to be domestic industries.
Capitalists set up factories where water-power was available, in
which children were largely employed, and factory villages grew
up round them. From about 1790 steam-power began gradually
to take the place of water-power; the change was slow, and
as it went on the manufacture became increasingly centred in
populous towns.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_219" id="TOPIC_219"></a>Cotton weaving remained a domestic industry, for Cartwright's
power-loom did not come into general use until after
1800. The output of yarn was enormous, and for a time the
weavers' earnings were very large, but the money which could be
earned at the loom and the failure of domestic spinning caused
so many to take to weaving that by 1800 wages had begun to
decline, and gradually a period of distress set in. A machine
for calico-printing further increased the profits of the capitalist
and had a bad effect on labour, for it threw the calico-printer
out of employment. Wool spinning was far more generally
carried on in rural districts than cotton spinning, and more
widely spread misery was caused by changes in the manufacture.
It came under the dominion of machinery somewhat later.
Machines for carding and combing took the place of manual
labour after 1790, and enabled one man and a few children to
do the work of many men. Spinning with the wheel lasted
longer than in the cotton manufacture. From 1785 jennies
were used, and wool spinning was gradually transferred to
factories and became a separate business, instead of a by-employment
which helped the small farmer to pay his rent
and eked out the scanty wages of the labourer. The change
was accelerated by the scarcity of wool during the revolutionary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
war, for by that time the trade had become largely dependent
on importation from Spain, and it was not until about 1800 that
sheep began to be bred for their wool in Australia. As in the
cotton trade, the wages of weavers were high during the war,
but the scarcity of material prevented all but the best workmen
from finding employment and there was much distress among
the rest. The failure of domestic spinning deeply affected all
the rural districts of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AGRICULTURAL WAGES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_220" id="TOPIC_220"></a>It was specially disastrous because it was accompanied by
times of scarceness and by changes connected with a revolution in
agriculture which pressed heavily on many of the poorer classes.
A rapid increase in population during the latter part of the
century was consequent on the stimulus given to manufacture;
in 1760 the population of England and Wales is estimated at
6,479,700, and of Scotland in 1755 at about 1,265,300; in 1800
the estimate for England and Wales is 9,187,176, and for Scotland
about 1,599,000. This increase implies a demand for a
larger supply of food. Early in the reign wages were low except
near great towns, and the law of settlement prevented the
labourer from moving freely from one parish to another in order
to better himself. While in 1769-70 labourers in Surrey earned
on an average from 8s. to 10s. a week, in Wiltshire they received
only 6s. 2d. to 5s. 3d., and in one district in Lancashire as little
as 4s. 11d.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Wages, however, were then eked out by home
industries and commonable rights. Yet the margin between
income and expenditure was so small that a rise in the price
of bread soon caused distress, and was often followed by riots.
Bread made from rye or barley was still eaten in poor districts,
but wheaten bread was more generally used than earlier in the
century, which proves that the condition of the poor was bettered.
In 1769 it cost 2d. a pound near London, and at a distance of
150 miles 1&frac12;d. Meat was about 3d. to 4d. a pound, rent and
clothing were cheap, firing and candles very dear.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_221" id="TOPIC_221"></a>In 1760 England was still a corn-exporting country; importation
was restrained, exportation encouraged by a bounty,
and in times of scarcity the trade was regulated by temporary
enactments. After some bad harvests an act was made in 1773
with the object of keeping the price steady at about 48s. the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
quarter; virtually free importation was allowed when it reached
that limit, and exportation was forbidden when it reached 44s.
Landowners and farmers were dissatisfied, and a general fear
lest the country should become dependent on foreign corn led
parliament in 1791 to adopt a policy of encouraging home production;
it was enacted that for the future a bounty should be paid
on exportation when the price was at 44s., that prohibitive duties
should be placed on importation when it was below 50s., and
virtually free importation only allowed above 54s. Nevertheless
from about that date England definitely ceased to be able to feed
her own people, except in good seasons. Her naval superiority
during the revolutionary war prevented a stoppage in the supply
of wheat from abroad; but it became uncertain, prices fluctuated
violently with good or bad harvests; war acted as a protection
to the corn-grower and bad harvests were followed by famine
prices; in 1795 wheat averaged 81s. 6d. in Windsor market, and
in 1800 reached 127s. Wages rose with the expansion of manufactures,
but not in anything like proportion to the rise in prices.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_222" id="TOPIC_222"></a>Meanwhile efforts were made to meet the increased demand
for food by improved agriculture. In 1760 about half
the parishes in England were still in open fields; and the
primitive two-field and three-field systems by which land was
refreshed by lying fallow were, with some modifications, still in
vogue. A new husbandry, however, had begun, and soon made
rapid progress; it was promoted by many large landowners,
such as Lord Townshend, the Dukes of Bedford and Grafton,
and Lord Rockingham, and the king took a lively and practical
interest in the movement. Its advantages were urged by
Arthur Young, who did most valuable work as its apostle. Its
leading feature was the introduction of a scientific rotation of
crops founded on the use of clover and rye-grass and the more
careful cultivation of turnips, which kept the land at once employed
and in good heart, and afforded a supply of excellent
fodder. Farmers, too, began to learn the profit to be derived
from marling, manuring, and subsoil drainage, and to use better
implements which did their work more thoroughly and with
less labour of man and beast. The increased demand for meat
caused sheep no longer to be valued chiefly for their wool, or
oxen as beasts of draught. Improvements in the breeding and
rearing of sheep and cattle were introduced by Bakewell, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Lincolnshire grazier, and carried on by others. The scraggy
animals of earlier days disappeared; the average weight of
beeves sold at Smithfield in 1710 was 370 lbs., in 1795 it was
800 lbs., and that of sheep had risen from 28 lbs. to 80 lbs.
Capital was freely invested in land; open fields were increasingly
enclosed, and commons and wastes along with them, and
land until then beyond the margin of cultivation was taken in
and ploughed. From 1760 to 1797 as many as 1,539 private enclosure
acts were passed, and a general act was passed in 1801.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_223" id="TOPIC_223"></a>The new agriculture vastly increased the produce of the
land. During the first half of our period rents were low, and
the farmers who carried out the new system as a rule made
enormous profits. Arthur Young tells us of one Norfolk farmer
who, on a farm of 1,500 acres, made enough in thirty years to
buy an estate of &pound;1,700 a year. The improved agriculture,
however, could not be carried out without enclosure and, unless
an award was made by agreement, that meant a large initial
expense, which was followed by the expense of actually enclosing
the land. These expenses were often borne by the landlords.
The small squires and yeomen who farmed their own land had
neither the intelligence of the large farmers nor the money to
spend on improvements, and both classes virtually disappeared.
Nor could the small farmer either keep his place or take advantage
of the new system. If his holding was unaffected by
enclosure, the loss of domestic industries rendered him less able
to pay his rent: if it was to be enclosed, he found himself with
a diminished income at the very time when he most needed
money; and if he managed to keep his land for a while, he was
ruined by some violent fluctuation in the price of corn. Sooner
or later he sank into the labouring class. The enormous profits
of the large farmers did not continue, for about 1780 rents began
to rise. Still the cultivation of good arable land remained highly
profitable, if the farmer had capital enough to meet fluctuations
of price. But war prices and parliamentary encouragement led
farmers to cultivate inferior land; their profits diminished in
proportion to the cost of cultivation, and though the supply of
food was increased, its price was kept up. A sudden fall in
prices would send the land back to its original wild state and
was likely enough to ruin the farmer.</p>

<p>Although enclosure was encouraged by parliament with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
view of benefiting the mass of the people by making bread
cheaper, it was far more often than not injurious to the labourer.
In many cases commons were enclosed without adequate compensation
to the poorer commoners, who were deprived of the
means of keeping a cow or geese or of the right of cutting turf
for fuel. Some received no allotment because they failed to
prove their claims, and others sold their allotments to wealthy
farmers, either because they were too small to keep a cow or
because they could not enclose them. Young, who strongly
advocated enclosure, says that out of thirty-seven parishes he
found only twelve in which the position of the poor had not
been injured by the enclosure of commons, and laments the
disastrous effect of the change on the general condition of the
labouring class. The change was coincident with the decay not
only of domestic spinning, but also of other industries practised
in villages, for the large new-fashioned farmers had their implements,
harness, and household utensils made and mended in
towns rather than by rural workmen. Deprived of the profits
of by-employments, and in many cases of their accustomed
rights of common, labourers became solely dependent on farm
wages at a time when prices were enormously high and a living-wage
was not to be gained by agricultural work. They either
migrated to seek work in a factory or came on the rates. In
many districts villages presented a picture of desolation. Wiston
and Foston in Leicestershire each before enclosure contained
some thirty-five houses; in Wiston every house disappeared
except that of the squire, and Foston was reduced to the parsonage
and two herdsmen's cottages.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COMBINATIONS OF WORKMEN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_224" id="TOPIC_224"></a>The old system of regulating wages by statute was not
wholly extinct in 1760. A few years later a statute made in
the masters' interests fixed the maximum for the wages of the
London journeymen tailors at 2s. 7&frac12;d. a day, except at a time
of general mourning. On the other hand parliament, in 1773,
under the pressure of a riot, passed an act empowering justices
to fix the wages of the Spitalfields silk weavers and to enforce
their ordinance. By 1776, however, Adam Smith declared that
the custom of fixing wages "had gone entirely into disuse".
England was adopting <i>laissez-faire</i>. The change of policy is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
illustrated by the case of the framework knitters of Nottinghamshire.
The employment of children and apprentices enabled
the masters to oppress them; they were unable to earn more than
8s. to 9s. a week and their wages were diminished by shameful
exactions. They formed a combination, petitioned the house of
commons to regulate their wages in 1778, and were heard before
a committee. A bill was brought in the next year to regulate
the trade and prevent abuses, but was thrown out on the third
reading. Wages were to be settled between the master and
the men. Some rioting followed on the rejection of the bill,
and the masters promised redress, but soon broke their word.
Combinations of workmen to set aside statutory arrangements
of wages were of course illegal, but when formed to secure their
fulfilment do not seem to have been so regarded.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In 1799,
however, when parliament was anxious to prevent seditious
assemblies, a statute, amended in 1800, rendered it unlawful for
workmen to combine for the purpose of obtaining higher wages.
This grossly unjust law made the workmen powerless to protect
themselves against the oppression of the capitalist employer.
Parliament was more than once pressed to meet the high price
of bread and the distress of the agricultural poor by fixing a
minimum for wages. Pitt, a disciple of Adam Smith, would
not consent to such a measure, and his opposition was fatal to
it. He was deeply sensible of the distress of the poor, and, in
1795, brought in a bill for the amendment of the poor law. It
contained some startling provisions of a socialistic character,
was adversely criticised by Bentham and others, and was quietly
dropped.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_225" id="TOPIC_225"></a>In 1760 the law of 1723, empowering overseers of the poor
to refuse relief to those who would not enter the workhouse,
was still in force. It seems to have been administered strictly,
and it kept down the rates. As society became more humane, it
revolted against so harsh a method of dealing with distress. A
permissive act of 1783, called after its promoter, Gilbert's act,
contained along with some wholesome provisions others that
were foolish and harmful; it enabled parishes to form unions
and adopt a system under which able-bodied men were not
allowed to enter the workhouse; they were to work in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
district and have their wages supplemented from the rates. The
administration of the act was committed to the magistrates and
guardians in place of the overseers. A considerable relaxation
of the law of settlement in 1795 was just and beneficial.
In the same year the pernicious principle of supplementing
wages from the rates was carried to its full extent. By that
time the decay of domestic spinning and the rise in the price of
food were causing much distress in Berkshire. At a meeting
of justices at Speenhamland in that county it was resolved to
grant allowances to all poor men and their families&mdash;so much
a head according to the price of the gallon loaf. This system
was generally adopted, and was strengthened by an act of 1795
abolishing the workhouse test. As a means of tiding over a
merely temporary crisis, as indeed it was intended by its
authors to be, it would have done no harm. Unfortunately, it
lasted for many years and had disastrous consequences; it
rapidly raised the rates, and helped to crush the small farmers
who, though they employed no labour, were forced to pay
towards the maintenance of the labourers employed by their
richer neighbours; it kept wages from rising, encouraged thriftless
marriages and dissolute living, discouraged industry and
efficient work, destroyed self-respect, and pauperised the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FACTORY CHILDREN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_226" id="TOPIC_226"></a>While then the last sixteen years of the century, of which
the political history still lies before us, were, except at certain
crises to be noted hereafter, marked by a rapid expansion of
commerce and trade, and an increase in the wealth of the richer
landowners, manufacturers, and merchants, they were, as we
have seen, a period of change in the conditions of labour and,
as such, brought much distress on the working class, which was
aggravated by the high prices consequent on bad seasons and
the risks of war. Of all the sufferings of the poor during this
period none are so painful to remember as those of the children
employed in factories, the helpless victims of <i>laissez-faire</i> for
whose relief the state did nothing until a later date. The
greater number of them were pauper apprentices bound by
parochial authorities to mill-owners, others the children of very
poor or callous parents. From little more than infancy, sometimes
under seven years old, children were condemned to labour
for long hours, thirteen or more in a day, at tasks which required
unremitting attention, and in rooms badly ventilated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
and otherwise injurious to health; they were half-starved and
cruelly punished when their wearied little arms failed to keep
up with the demands of the machinery. The smaller mills were
the worst in this respect, and as the supply of water-power was
not constant, the children in mills worked by water were often
forced to labour far beyond their strength to make up for lost
time. Such of them as survived the prolonged misery and
torture of their early years often grew up more or less stunted
and deformed men and women, physically unfit for parentage,
morally debased, ignorant, and brutalised by ill-treatment.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>EARLY YEARS OF PITT'S ADMINISTRATION.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_227" id="TOPIC_227"></a>The general election of 1784 which established Pitt in office
was the expression of a strong national feeling. Humiliated
by the loss of its colonies, irritated by the mismanagement of
its affairs, and burdened with the expense of an unsuccessful
war, which added &pound;114,500,000 to the public debt, the nation
listened with approval to Fox's denunciations and got rid of
North. It was with unbounded disgust that it saw Fox enter
into an alliance with the statesman whom he had denounced as
the prime cause of its misfortunes. During the late conflict in
parliament public feeling grew strong against him. The king's
dismissal of a ministry which commanded a large majority in
the house of commons, and his refusal to dismiss its successor at
the request of the house needed no pardon; they were endorsed
by the declaration of the national will, and he gained a hold on
the affection of his people such as he had never had before. His
success must not make us forget the courage and the political
insight which he displayed during this critical period. All that
made the crown worth wearing was at stake, for if Fox's party
had obtained a majority at the general election, George for the
rest of his life would have become a mere puppet in their hands.
He won the game, but he did not win all that he hoped for.
Pitt, whom he chose as his champion, was not a minister after
his own heart, content to carry out a royal policy. George freed
himself from the danger of whig domination, but he did so at
the cost of resigning his hopes of establishing a system of personal
government, and accepted an independent prime minister.
He never liked Pitt, but he knew that Pitt stood between him
and Fox, and so for seventeen years was content that he should
retain office. Pitt's power was established by, and rested on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the will of the nation. In 1784 England looked forward with
hope to the rule of a young minister, a son of the great
Chatham, of stainless private character and unimpeachable integrity,
who was free from all responsibility for its misfortunes,
and was the victorious opponent of Fox, whom it regarded with
aversion. Nor did its hope fail of fulfilment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LASTING CHANGES EFFECTED BY PITT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_228" id="TOPIC_228"></a>What the government did for England during the nine
years of peace which succeeded the election of 1784 may be
said to have been done by Pitt. His colleagues were not men
of great capacity, and he received obedience rather than counsel
from them. So it was that the position of prime minister, a
title which North refused to accept, became finally established.
This unavowed change in the constitution settled the sphere of
political action open to the crown. Government by the crown
through departmental ministers acting independently of each
other was no longer possible. The principle of the homogeneous
character of the cabinet and of the prime minister's position in
it were, as we shall see, decisively settled in 1791 by the dismissal
of the chancellor, who, relying on the king's favour, wore
out Pitt's patience by rebellion against his authority. Pitt's
strength of character and the king's dependence on him caused
the gradual extinction of the "king's friends" as a party distinct
from the supporters of the government. The leader of the party
Jenkinson, the secretary at war in North's ministry, had great
commercial knowledge; Pitt made him president of the new
board of trade which was constituted in 1785, and as Lord
Hawkesbury and as Earl of Liverpool he gave the prime minister
his support. Pitt did not attempt to reduce the crown to a
cypher, and George exercised a strong and legitimate influence
in politics, as adviser of the cabinet, though Pitt occasionally
acted against his wishes.</p>

<p>Another change of lasting importance effected by Pitt was in
the character of the house of lords. In 1760 the whole number
of peers, including minors and Roman catholics, who were
incapable of sitting in the house, was only 174; the house was
then the stronghold of the whig oligarchy. During North's
administration about thirty peers were created or promoted.
Under Pitt the invasion advanced far more rapidly. Economical
reform deprived the minister of the power of rewarding his
supporters with places and pensions, and Pitt used peerages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and minor honours in their stead. George, who did not approve
of a large increase in the peerage,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> was forced to yield to his
minister's exigencies. In five years Pitt was responsible for
forty-eight creations and promotions, and by 1801 the number
reached 140.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The house of lords ceased to be a small
assembly of territorial magnates, mostly of the whig party;
it became less aristocratic, for peerages were bestowed on men
simply because they were supporters of the government and
were wealthy; it became mainly tory in politics, and its size
made it less open to corrupt influence. As a body, however, it
was inferior in ability and in devotion to its legislative duties
to the small assembly of earlier days.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_229" id="TOPIC_229"></a>Under Pitt's leadership, England during the years of peace
which succeeded the American war regained her place in the
politics of Europe. His attention, however, was chiefly devoted
to domestic affairs. He was eminently skilful in finance; he
restored the public credit and freed trade from artificial impediments.
The corruption of parliament, of which both whigs and
tories had been guilty, was brought to an end; many abuses and
sinecures were abolished and public life became purer. Though
at first Pitt sustained some defeats in parliament, due both to
mistakes of his own and to the absence of party consolidation
among his usual supporters, his power rapidly increased until it
became absolute in both houses. He showed supreme ability
in the management of parliament. With much of his father's
haughtiness of manner he combined a tactfulness and self-control
which his father never exhibited. He had nothing of Fox's
winning power, yet he became extremely popular in the house
of commons, for he showed himself worthy to lead men and able
to lead them successfully. His temper was sweet, his courage,
patience, and hopefulness unfailing, and his industry unwearied.
That he loved power is surely no reproach to a statesman who
used it as he did with single-hearted devotion to his country.
For wealth and honours he cared nothing. He was always poor,
and soon became deeply in debt, chiefly because he was too much
occupied with public affairs to control his household expenditure.
While he disdainfully distributed titles and ribbons among a
clamouring crowd, he refused all such things for himself. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
measures of reform which he advocated in early days he dropped
when he found that the country did not care for them, and in
later days altogether abandoned a liberal policy, for he was called
on to give England that which is infinitely more important than
liberal measures, the preservation of its constitutional and social
life from the danger of revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WESTMINSTER SCRUTINY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_230" id="TOPIC_230"></a>When parliament met on May 19, 1784, the ministry carried
the address in the commons by 282 to 114. Pitt, however, soon
found that he could not reckon on this majority on every question.
In the Westminster election Fox had been opposed by
Admiral Lord Hood, created an Irish baron after the battle of
the Saints, and Sir Cecil Wray. The poll was kept open for
forty days and there was much rioting and irregularity of every
kind, for which both sides appear to have been responsible.
Fox's friends, and above all the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire
and other whig ladies, canvassed eagerly for him, and the
duchess is said to have bought a butcher's vote with a kiss.
George watched the contest with anxiety, for Fox's attack on
the constitutional rights of the crown had deepened his animosity
towards him. So strong were his feelings that, on hearing that
Fox was gaining votes, he wrote to Pitt that "the advance
could only be by bad votes, yet similar means must be adopted
against him rather than let him get returned". He had heard
with delight that 300 Quackers (<i>sic</i>) would vote for Hood and
Wray.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> At the close of the poll Hood stood first and Fox
second. Great was the triumph of the Foxites, and the Prince
of Wales, Fox's pupil in debauchery, was pleased to exhibit his
opposition to his father by taking a prominent part in it; he
wore Fox's colours, was present at banquets in his honour,
where he gave the toast of "True Blue and Mrs. Crewe," one
of Fox's lady canvassers, and got disgustingly drunk. Nevertheless
the victory was disputed, for the high-bailiff granted a
scrutiny, and instead of returning Hood and Fox as elected,
merely reported the number of the votes. In this he was clearly
wrong, for he made no proper return to the writ. If a scrutiny
was to be held, it should have been completed before the day
fixed for the return. It was his duty to make a return on that
day; a decision as to the lawfulness of the election pertained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
to the house of commons. His action deprived Westminster of
representation, and would have shut Fox out of the house had
he not already been returned for Kirkwall.</p>

<p>Fox petitioned the house to order the high-bailiff to make
a proper return. Pitt opposed the petition, and the house
ordered that the scrutiny should proceed, though in two divisions
on the question his majority fell to 97 and 78. Eight
months later, in February, 1785, the scrutiny was still proceeding
and was likely to last two years longer. Against the king's
judgment,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Pitt persisted in maintaining it; his majority sank
to 39, then to 9, and on March 4 he was in a minority of 38.
The high-bailiff was ordered to make an immediate return, and
Hood and Fox were returned as elected. In this matter Pitt
did not display his usual tactfulness. Excusably enough in so
young a man, he allowed himself to be swayed by personal
feeling, and his feeling was ungenerous. With the exception
of a small knot of friends like Dundas, he kept himself aloof
from his supporters and was ignorant of the annoyance with
which they regarded this attempt to deal harshly with a defeated
foe.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> A bill passed that session ordered that polls were not to
last more than fifteen days, and that any scrutiny should be
closed six days before the return to the writ was due. Fox
sued the high-bailiff for neglecting to return him and obtained
&pound;2,000 damages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S FINANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_231" id="TOPIC_231"></a>In spite of this mistake Pitt's position was strengthened by
his success in dealing with finance. National credit was low;
the public debt of Great Britain had grown from &pound;126,043,057
in 1775 to &pound;240,925,908,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and the 3 per cent. consols were at
about 57. Heavy expenses entailed by the late war were still
to be met, the civil list was in arrear, and the revenue was
grievously diminished by smuggling. In order to make smuggling
less profitable, Pitt largely reduced the duties on tea and
foreign spirits, and made up the loss on the tea duties by a
"commutation tax," an increased duty on houses according to
the number of their windows. He also made smuggling more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
difficult by a "hovering act," which subjected to seizure vessels
hovering off the coast with any considerable quantity of tea or
spirits. A deficit of &pound;6,000,000 he supplied by a loan, and in
raising this loan he abandoned the old evil practice of allotment
among selected subscribers and opened it to public competition.
A second point on which he made a new departure was his
declaration that all sound finance should be directed towards
extinguishing debt and that consequently "a fund at a high rate
of interest was better for the country than those at low rates".
The unfunded debts were large, those ascertained amounted to
&pound;14,000,000, and as outstanding government bills were at a
discount of 15 to 20 per cent., these debts depressed the funds.
Pitt at once funded nearly half as an instalment. Lastly the
required charges exceeded revenue by over &pound;900,000, an
enormous sum for that time, and he proposed to make up the
deficiency by taxation.</p>

<p>The number of the new taxes is a third point specially to be
noted in his budget. One proposed tax, on coals, he withdrew
in deference to general opinion, and substituted others in its
place. The rest met with little opposition. As they finally
stood they were laid on candles, bricks and tiles, hats, pleasure
horses and horses entered for races, British linens and cottons,
ribbons and gauzes, ale-licences, shooting licences, paper, hackney
coaches, gold and silver plate, exported lead, postage, and
imported raw and thrown silk. His speech on the budget, during
which he moved 133 resolutions, at once placed his talents
as a finance minister beyond dispute; it was admirably lucid
and was conciliatory in tone. He also carried some regulations
checking the abuse of the privilege of franking letters. In those
days a letter which bore on the outside the signature of a member
of parliament was carried post-free, and franks were given
away with the utmost profusion. It was calculated that the new
regulations, without abolishing the privilege, would increase the
revenue by &pound;20,000. The next year, 1785, Pitt completed the
funding of unfunded debt, choosing according to his principle
the 5 per cents. which, though entailing an immediate loss,
afforded an easy means of paying off debt. He was able to
declare that the revenues were in a flourishing state, and to
speak of the institution of a fund for the repayment of the
national debt as in the near future. He was, however, still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
obliged to raise &pound;400,000 by new taxes. Among these were
an increased tax on male servants, graduated according to the
number kept, and two which excited much hostile criticism, the
one a tax on female servants, also graduated, two shillings and
sixpence on one, five shillings a head on two, and ten shillings
a head on three or more, and the other a tax on shops. Both
these taxes were unpopular; the shop tax was repealed in 1789
and the tax on female servants in 1792.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_232" id="TOPIC_232"></a>In 1784 the East India company was applying to parliament
for help, and as its affairs were under investigation it was unable
to declare a dividend. Pitt carried bills authorising a dividend
of 8 per cent., and granting the company relief from obligations
to the exchequer which the late war made specially onerous.
He then brought in his new bill for the government of India.
This measure, which was not materially different from his bill
of six months before, entirely subordinated the political power
exercised by the directors to a board of control consisting of
unpaid commissioners, a secretary of state, the chancellor of the
exchequer, and other privy councillors, appointed by the crown.
The patronage of India was to be retained by the directors, but
the governor-general and the presidents and members of councils
were to be appointed and to be removable by the crown. In all
matters of peace and war the governor-general and his council
were to be supreme over the minor presidencies. Regulations
were made to prevent extortion by the officers of the company,
and a special court was instituted for the trial of those charged
with delinquencies. The bill was violently opposed by Fox,
Burke, Sheridan, and Hastings's enemy, Francis, chiefly on the
grounds that government and patronage ought not to be divided,
that the nominal sovereignty of the directors and the extensive
power of the board of control would lead to confusion, and that
the governor-general ought not to have absolute authority in
matters at a distance. After several divisions, Pitt carried the
second reading in the commons by a majority of 211; he
accepted some amendments in committee, and the bill finally
passed both houses without a division. Thus was established
that system of double government which lasted until 1858.</p>

<p>The session closed with a motion by Dundas for the restoration
of the Scottish estates forfeited for the rebellion of 1745.
The bill was unanimously approved by the commons. Thurlow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
who for some reason, possibly merely from jealousy of Pitt,
adopted a generally malcontent attitude, spoke against it in the
lords, but it passed there also without a division. Before the
end of the year Pitt's success was declared by the accession to
his ministry of old Lord Camden as president of the council in
the place of Lord Gower, who took the office of privy seal,
vacated by the appointment of the Duke of Rutland as viceroy
of Ireland in the previous February. Shelburne, who was
deeply offended by his continued exclusion from office, was
created Marquis of Lansdowne with the promise that, if the
king made any dukes outside his own family, he should be one
of the number. He was not appeased by this promotion, and
remained hostile to Pitt, who would have been weakened by his
alliance and lost nothing by his hostility. Temple, who also
aspired to a dukedom, was created Marquis of Buckingham, and
was encouraged to hope that his ambition might in the future
be fully satisfied. The session closed on August 20. Parliament
did not meet again until January 25, 1785, and from that time
the custom of beginning the regular session before Christmas
has been discontinued.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S PARLIAMENTARY REFORM BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_233" id="TOPIC_233"></a>As Pitt had already twice brought forward motions for parliamentary
reform, in 1782 and 1783, the friends of the cause
looked to him to promote it as head of the ministry. The
question was not at that time exciting much public interest.
The king was personally opposed to reform, and it was not
until March, 1785, that Pitt obtained his assent to the introduction
of a bill. He promised the king that if it was rejected he
would not resign, unless "those supposed to be connected with
government" voted against it. George took the hint, and while
he expressed dislike of the bill to Pitt, assured him that he would
not use any influence against it. Pitt did his best to insure the
success of his bill, and even persuaded his friend Wilberforce
to return from abroad to support it. He brought forward
his motion on April 18. After defending himself from the
charge of innovation by pointing out that in past ages changes
had frequently been made in the representation, he laid down
that the representation of boroughs should depend not on
locality but on the number of voters. He proposed to disfranchise
thirty-six decayed boroughs, and to add their seventy-two
members to the representation of counties and of London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and Westminster. The boroughs were to be disfranchised at
their own request, which was to be obtained by the purchase
of their franchise from a fund provided by the state. In the
future any other borough which was, or became, so decayed as
to fall below a standard fixed by parliament, was to be allowed
to surrender its franchise for an adequate payment, and its
right would be transferred to populous towns. He further
proposed to extend the franchise to copyholders, and in towns
to householders.</p>

<p>According to his plan &pound;1,000,000 sterling was to be set aside
for compensation; 100 members would eventually be chosen
by free and open constituencies instead of by individuals or
close corporations, and some 99,000 persons would receive the
franchise. North spoke ably against the motion, dwelling on
the coldness with which the country regarded the question;
only eight petitions for reform were presented, and none came
from Birmingham or Manchester. Fox opposed it on the
ground that the franchise was a trust, not a property, and that
to offer to buy it was contrary to the spirit of the constitution;
and Burke objected to the alteration which it would make in
the representation of interests by increasing the influence of the
country gentlemen. Pitt allowed that the scheme of purchase
was a "tender part"; it was, he said, "a necessary evil if any
reform was to take place". Leave to bring in the bill was
refused by 248 to 174. Pitt had not yet secured an organised
majority. Connexion and influence had not wholly given way
to a system of parties founded on general agreement on political
questions. There is no reason to suppose that the king broke
his promise to Pitt, but his dislike of reform must have been
well known, and probably had much weight. Pitt made no
more attempts at parliamentary reform, and for the next seven
years the question was of little importance in English politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REFORM DEMANDED IN IRELAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_234" id="TOPIC_234"></a>The chief conflict of the session was fought over Pitt's
scheme for establishing free-trade with Ireland. An agitation
for parliamentary reform in Ireland brought into prominence a
spirit of discontent. The Irish parliament did not represent
even the protestant population; the house of lords was composed
of a large number of bishops, generally subservient to
the crown, and of lay lords, many of them lately ennobled for
political service; the house of commons of 300 members, scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
a third of them elected by the people. Flood urged reform
on a strictly protestant basis, and the cause of reform was
supported by a convention of volunteers assembled at Dublin
under Lord Charlemont. The Bishop of Derry, Lord Bristol,
a vain and half-crazy prelate, advocated the admission of catholics
to the franchise, and tried to excite the volunteers, who
were then no longer exclusively protestant, and were recruited
from the rabble, to extort reform from parliament by force.
He attended parliament with an escort of volunteers and in
regal state, and appeared in a purple coat and volunteer cap
fiercely cocked. His seditious behaviour, the claim made for
the catholics, and the violence of the democratic party caused
a division among the volunteers and among the advocates of
reform generally. Charlemont and Flood himself checked the
violent party in the convention, which was dissolved peacefully.
Flood's motions for reform were rejected, and the volunteer
movement lost political importance. Pitt regarded parliamentary
reform in Ireland as certain if it were adopted in England,
and was prepared to welcome it, but was at that time determined
to maintain the exclusion of the catholics from the
franchise. The Irish administration was opposed to a change
of system, and the Duke of Rutland, the viceroy, a young man
of great ability, held that the state of the country would render
it dangerous. The defeat of Flood's last attempt at reform, in
1785, left the Irish parliament as before without "the smallest
resemblance to representation".<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>In face of the threatened interference in politics of an armed
force, of discontent and disloyalty, and foreseeing difficulties in
the future between the independent Irish parliament and the
imperial government, Rutland prophesied in 1784 that "without
an union Ireland would not be connected with Great Britain
in twenty years longer".<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Pitt hoped to pacify discontent by
benefiting Irish trade, and to unite the two countries by a
community of interest. His plan, to which he attached more
importance than to Irish reform, though commercial in character,
was based on a lofty political conception; it was designed
to promote "the prosperity of the empire at large".<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> North's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
concessions to Ireland in 1779 and the subsequent establishment
of Irish legislative independence left both countries at
liberty to regulate each its own trade. Ireland admitted
English goods free or at low duties; and England shut out
most Irish manufactures, though admitting linen, the manufacture
of which was encouraged by a bounty, and, for her own
convenience, woollen yarn free of duty. Ireland, too, though
enabled to trade directly with the English colonies, could neither
send their products to England nor buy them from England.
Pitt designed to establish perpetual free trade between England
and Ireland, and as Ireland would be the gainer by the change,
he proposed that in return she should contribute a fixed sum to
the naval defence of the empire. Rutland, who saw that sending
money to England would be violently opposed, suggested
that the contribution should be spent on a portion of the navy
to be kept on the Irish coasts. In words which it is well to
remember, Pitt pointed out that "there can be but one navy
for the empire at large, and it must be administered by the
executive in this country".<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The resolutions he sent over to
be presented to the Irish parliament provided that the contribution
should come from the surplus which the grant of free trade
would create in the hereditary revenue of the crown, for, as that
revenue was chiefly made up of customs and excise, the payment
would be in exact proportion to the benefits conferred by
the change.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S RESOLUTIONS ON IRISH COMMERCE.</i></div>

<p>As, however, Ireland had a heavy debt, which was largely
due to the extravagance of government, Grattan insisted that
the contribution should depend on the yearly equalisation of the
revenue with the expenses. The Irish government yielded to
his demand, and with that change the resolutions were carried.
Pitt brought them before the English house of commons on
February 22 in a speech of remarkable power. Fox, who had
long been hoping "to make his harvest from Ireland,"<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> opposed
them as injurious to British manufacture. The manufacturers at
once took the alarm; a petition with 80,000 signatures was sent
up from Lancashire against the resolutions, and a "chamber of
manufacturers," with Wedgwood as president, vigorously protested
against them. English manufactures, it was asserted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
would be undersold and ruined by goods produced by cheap
labour in Ireland. After evidence had been heard on the
matter for twelve weeks, Pitt saw that he must modify his
scheme. On May 12 he brought forward a new set of resolutions
less generous to Ireland, and providing that in commercial
legislation the Irish parliament should perpetually be bound
by the parliament of Great Britain. Fox, North, and Sheridan
vehemently opposed them, and Fox denounced the whole plan
as an attempt to lure Ireland to surrender her liberty. "I will
not," said he, "barter English commerce for Irish slavery; that
is not the price I would pay, nor is this the thing I would
purchase." Nevertheless after long and warm debates, Pitt
triumphantly carried his resolutions. The speeches of Fox and
Sheridan found a loud echo in the Irish parliament; Grattan, in
an impassioned speech, condemned the new resolutions, and they
passed the commons only by 127 to 108. So strong an expression
of adverse feeling forced Pitt to abandon his scheme. Thus
was his wise and hopeful attempt to encourage Irish trade and
strengthen the bond between the two countries wrecked by the
factiousness of the opposition, the selfishness of the manufacturers
in England, and the susceptibility of the Irish liberal
party. Fox's opposition to free trade with Ireland brought him
a temporary return of popularity in the manufacturing districts.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_235" id="TOPIC_235"></a>Pitt's command of the house of commons was still uncertain.
In February, 1786, he was defeated on a bill for fortifying
the dockyards at Plymouth and Portsmouth. His defeat was
largely due to the unpopularity of the Duke of Richmond, the
author of the plan, who had not gained in general esteem by
deserting his former party, and to the old prejudice against
increasing the military power of the crown. Yet it illustrates
Pitt's position at the time. It was a "loose parliament"; the
majority voted every man as he had a mind; Pitt had yet to
bind his party together, and his cold and repellent manners
still hindered him from making friends.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> His power was
strengthened in this session by the general approval elicited by
his bill for the reduction of the national debt by means of a
sinking fund. In forming his plan he received much help from
Price, a nonconformist minister, distinguished as a writer on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
financial questions. When introducing his bill he was able to
show that the public revenue would exceed the expenditure by
about &pound;900,000, which he proposed to raise to &pound;1,000,000 by
some new taxes not of a burdensome nature, ample resources
existing to meet a temporary excess in naval and military
expenditure caused by the late war. That the revenue would
continue to improve seemed assured by the increase in the customs
due to Pitt's measures against smuggling. Government
might reckon on at least &pound;1,000,000 surplus, and that sum he
proposed to make the foundation of his new sinking fund.
Unlike the sinking fund established by Sir Robert Walpole
in 1716, which had from time to time been diverted to other
purposes, his fund was to be kept inviolate in war as well as in
peace, and applied solely to the discharge of debt. To secure
this, he proposed that in every quarter of each succeeding year
&pound;250,000 should be paid to six commissioners of high position,
and should be used by them in the purchase of stock. The
interest of such stock, together with the savings effected by the
expiration of annuities, was to be invested periodically in the
same way. The fund thus created would then accumulate at
compound interest and become a sinking fund for the extinction
of the national debt.</p>

<p>The bill passed both houses without a division. The highest
expectations were founded upon it, for people generally, in common
with Pitt himself and Price, regarded the new fund as an
infallible means of discharging the national debt solely by the uninterrupted
operation of compound interest. That the application
of surplus revenue to the payment of debt is sound finance, and
that to treat surpluses designed for that purpose as a separate
fund is a convenient arrangement need no demonstration. There
is not, however, anything magical or automatic in the operation of
compound interest, nor can the separation of a sinking fund from
general revenue have any real efficacy. Reduction of national
debt, whatever arrangements may be made for it, can only be
effected by taxation. During the years of peace, when the
revenue was in excess of expenditure, Pitt's sinking fund acted
as a convenient mode of reducing the debt. In 1792 a second
fund of 1 per cent. on all loans was established, and by 1793
the commissioners had reduced the debt by about &pound;10,000,000.
Then came the war with France; the revenue fell short of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
expenditure, and Pitt met the deficiency by large loans raised at
great expense. Yet in order to preserve the benefit which, it was
believed, was derived from the uninterrupted operation of compound
interest, the payments to the sinking fund were regularly
continued, so that the state was actually borrowing money at a
high rate of interest in order to reduce a debt at a low rate of
interest. No member of the opposition saw the fallacy involved
in Pitt's scheme. He is said, probably with truth, to have himself
discovered it later, but he maintained the fund, which was
useful as a means of keeping the duty of reduction of debt before
the nation and of helping it to face with hopefulness the rapid
accumulation of debt during the war with France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH FRANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_236" id="TOPIC_236"></a>In 1787 Pitt laid before parliament a treaty of navigation
and commerce with France. The treaty of Versailles in 1783
provided that commissioners should be appointed to make
commercial arrangements between the two countries. The
French cabinet invited Shelburne to proceed in the matter, and
he was about to do so when he was driven from office. Fox
was opposed to a treaty. Pitt appointed a commissioner in
April, 1784, but nothing further was done. It was a critical
matter, for a commercial treaty with France was certain to give
some offence at home, and Pitt may for that reason alone have
been willing to delay action until his position was more secure.
In 1785 the French council of state, irritated by the large influx
of British manufactures which were smuggled into France,
issued <i>arr&ecirc;ts</i> restraining trade with Great Britain. Pitt was too
wise to retaliate. His opportunity had come, and he entrusted
the negotiations to Eden, who deserted the opposition and accepted
a seat on the new board of trade. Eden had a thorough
knowledge of commercial affairs, and carried out his mission as
envoy to the French court with great success.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The treaty,
signed on September 26, 1786, reduced the duties on many
of the principal articles of commerce of both countries, and
put others not specified on the most-favoured-nation footing.
A large and easily accessible market was opened to British
commerce, and, as the exports of France were for the most
part not produced in England and the French were in want of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
British products, both countries would, Pitt argued, be gainers by
an increase in the freedom of their trade one with the other, and
political ill-feeling would be diminished by more intimate and
mutually profitable relations. The navigation clauses showed
as liberal a spirit as the commercial; an enemy's goods carried
in the ships of either country were to be held free by the other,
except contraband of war, which was limited to warlike implements
and was not to include naval stores.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_237" id="TOPIC_237"></a>The treaty favoured the interests of the consumer, and was
contrary to the economic principles of the whigs, who maintained
that commerce should be regulated so as to promote home
industry. Fox strongly objected to it in parliament, mainly on
the ground that France was "the natural foe of Great Britain,"
and that any close connexion with her was dangerous. Sheridan
and Charles Grey, afterwards the second Earl Grey, in
his maiden speech joined him in condemning the treaty, but
it was approved of by large majorities. Though it caused
some temporary displeasure among the manufacturers, it was followed
by a large increase of trade with France. Among Pitt's
achievements as minister in time of peace none deserves to be
ranked higher than this treaty, whether regarded in its details,
or as a monument of his enlightened commercial policy, or as
illustrating his statesmanlike view of the relations which it was
desirable to establish between the two countries. His credit
was further strengthened in the same session by his bill for
the consolidation of the customs and excise. The customs
duties, fixed from time to time, some on one system and some
on another, were so complex that no one could be sure what he
might be required to pay, and merchants often depended on
the custom-house officers to tell them the amount due on goods.
The excise, though in a less confused state, was also in urgent
need of regulation. Pitt abolished the whole mass of existing
duties with their percentages and drawbacks, and put a single
duty on each article as nearly as possible of the same amount
as before. These duties and all other taxes he brought into
a consolidated fund on which all public debts were secured.
Simple as this change appears, it involved about 3,000 resolutions.
While it only slightly increased the revenue, it was a
great benefit to merchants, it simplified the work in public
offices, prevented officials from abusing their power, and en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>abled
Pitt to get rid of a large number of custom-house sinecures,
and so at once to effect an economy and dry up a source of
corruption. The bill received a warm welcome from Burke, and
was passed without a division.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BILL FOR RELIEF OF DISSENTERS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_238" id="TOPIC_238"></a>Pitt's position in the commons was not yet one of command.
In 1788 his party, those who recognised him as their leader,
was said to number only 52, while Fox's party, the regular
opposition, was estimated at 138; the "crown party" which
might be reckoned on to uphold the government for the time
being "under any minister not peculiarly unpopular," consisted
of 185, and the rest were "independent" members, whose votes
were uncertain. Pitt then had to walk warily. His practical
temperament was in his favour. That the country should be
well governed, and that it should be governed by himself, which
was the same thing to him, as it is probably to all great ministers,
was the object of his life. Compared with that, special
questions were of small importance. There was nothing doctrinaire
in his turn of mind; the abstract righteousness of a
cause did not appeal to him, and could not divert him from the
pursuit of his main object. In 1787 a bill for the relief of
dissenters by the repeal of the test and corporation acts of the
reign of Charles II. was brought in by Beaufoy, a supporter of
the government. In reality the dissenters suffered very little
from these acts, for they were relieved by annual acts of indemnity.
Yet their grievance was not wholly sentimental, and, even
had it been so, it would still have been a grievance. The
opposition was divided; North opposed the bill, Fox warmly
advocated it. Pitt consulted the bishops. All save two were
against it. He valued the support of the Church, and declared
himself against the bill, which was rejected by a majority of 78.
In 1789 the majority against it sank to 22. Yet Pitt was
thoroughly high-principled. As we shall see later in the case of
Hastings, he would not be false to his convictions, and if he
judged that a cause was worth maintaining, even at the cost of
weakening his own position, he did not shrink from his duty.
This is proved by his conduct with reference to the slave trade.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_239" id="TOPIC_239"></a>The cruelties attendant on the trade were forcibly represented
by a society for procuring its abolition, founded in 1787,
mainly by quakers, of which Granville Sharp and Clarkson
were prominent members. Wilberforce's sympathy was already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
aroused by reports of the sufferings of the negroes in the slave-ships.
Pitt advised him to undertake the question in parliament,
and as a preliminary agreed to the appointment of a committee
to inquire into the methods of the trade. The merchants of
London, Lancashire, and Bristol were indignant at the threatened
interference, and efforts were made to conceal the truth. Nevertheless
the abominable cruelties to which the slaves were subjected
during the middle passage were clearly proved. Chained
to their places, fettered and fastened together, they were packed
so closely on the lower decks and in stifling holds that they
could scarcely turn, they were kept short of food and water,
and were exercised to keep them alive by being forced under
pain of the lash to jump in their fetters. While Wilberforce
was ill in 1788, Pitt gave notice of a motion on the trade, and
supported a bill moved by Sir William Dolben which mitigated
the sufferings of the negroes during the passage. In 1789
Wilberforce in a long and eloquent speech moved resolutions
for the abolition of the trade, and Pitt, Fox, who was always
quick to feel for human suffering, and Burke joined in supporting
him. Pitt's conduct on this question displeased many of his
followers. The interests concerned in the trade were powerful,
and for a time the question was virtually shelved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AUSTRIA AND THE UNITED PROVINCES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_240" id="TOPIC_240"></a>The peace of Versailles left England isolated. The new
government was to show that she was able and ready to reassert
her right to exercise an influence in Europe. The political
situation presented three alliances, of France and Austria,
Austria and Russia, France and Spain, and opposed to them
two isolated powers, England and Prussia. None of these
alliances directly threatened England, yet there were elements
of danger in the two first. After the death of Maria Theresa,
in 1780, her son Joseph II. changed the general direction of
Austria's policy. He was restless and full of great schemes
which he looked to Russia rather than France to support. The
growth of Russian power under Catherine had changed the
political state of Europe. The treaty of Kutchuk Kainardji, in
1774, at the close of a successful war against the Turks, saw
Russia strongly established on the Black Sea; the partition of
Poland augmented her preponderance in the north: and in 1780
England found that her maritime interests were threatened by a
power seated both on the Baltic and close to the Mediterranean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Catherine welcomed the overtures of Joseph, for she contemplated
further conquests from the Turks, and the good-will of
Austria was important to her. Of these two allied powers
Austria was the more dangerous to England and Prussia.
Russia had already gained much, Austria was hoping for gain;
Catherine was looking mainly to extension in eastern, Joseph's
ambitions tended to disturb the balance of power in western and
central Europe. France was impoverished; she desired peace
and was anxious to restrain the emperor's ambition, and Spain
could do nothing without her. A quadruple alliance, then,
between the two imperial courts and France and Spain was
impossible. The late war had raised the Bourbon influence in
Europe. England was unable to detach Austria from France,
and to form an alliance, as Carmarthen wished, with the two
imperial courts; and she was, as we shall see, led by a conflict
in Holland to enter into an agreement with Prussia which had
important results.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_241" id="TOPIC_241"></a>Her foreign policy between 1784 and 1788 was chiefly
concerned with the affairs of the United Provinces. Anxious
to remove the restrictions imposed by treaties on the Austrian
Netherlands, Joseph set aside the Barrier treaty of 1715, designed
to check French aggression; and the Dutch withdrew
their garrisons from the border fortresses. He pressed other
claims upon them, relying on their weakness, for they paid
dearly for provoking a war with England; and he demanded
that the Scheldt, which was closed by the treaty of 1648, should
be open to navigation. His claim concerned England, for though
Austria could never become a great naval power even if Antwerp
had access to the sea, the ports of the Netherlands and, indeed,
of the United Provinces might fall under the control of some
strong maritime state, such as France or Russia. Joseph's
demand was backed by a recommendation from the Russian
empress. He sent ships to sail up and down the river, and they
were forcibly stopped by the Dutch. War seemed imminent.
France, however, was then gaining great influence in Holland,
and though she compelled the Dutch to assent to some of the
emperor's demands, she upheld their refusal with regard to the
Scheldt, and negotiated a treaty concluded at Fontainebleau in
November, 1785, between the emperor and the republic, by which
Joseph renounced his demand for the opening of the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRENCH INFLUENCE IN HOLLAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_242" id="TOPIC_242"></a>He was already occupied in renewing a scheme, which had
been defeated in 1778, for exchanging his Netherland provinces
for Bavaria. This project was highly prejudicial to Prussian
interests in Germany; and Frederick of Prussia baulked it by
forming a F&uuml;rstenbund, or alliance of princes, to maintain the
integrity of the Germanic constitution. In February, 1785,
he invited King George as Elector of Hanover to join in this
projected alliance. George willingly assented, for the alliance
was beneficial to Hanover; and in a letter to his Hanoverian
minister he expressed the hope that his assent would lead to
an understanding between England and Prussia. This was
merely an expression of his private feelings; the F&uuml;rstenbund
was not a matter of English politics and did not, in fact, bring
about an Anglo-Prussian alliance.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Such an alliance was highly
desirable for England as a means of defeating the intrigues
of France in the United Provinces. The more republican or
"patriot" party in Holland, which had led the states to break
their ancient friendly relations with England, was completely
under French influence, and, relying on the support of France,
designed to compel the stadholder, William V. of Orange, a
feeble and irresolute prince, to resign his office. Their victory
would have made the republic virtually a French province, and
would have brought France a great accession of naval power.
Sir James Harris, the British ambassador at the Hague, laboured
to counteract their designs by encouraging the party in the
republic opposed to the policy of Holland. The stadholder's
wife, a princess of high spirit, was a niece of Frederick the
Great, and Harris was anxious for an alliance between England
and Prussia as a means of overthrowing the French party.
Ewart, the ambassador at Berlin, shared his views, but the
ambassadors were held back by Carmarthen. The cabinet,
Harris declared, was wholly occupied by domestic matters.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>In May, 1785, it was evident that Austria was in accord
with France, and the cabinet inquired what Frederick's intentions
were, hoping that his desire that England would join in
preventing the Bavarian exchange would induce him to oppose
the ambitious designs of France, and to form a union of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
defence.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Frederick spoke freely to Ewart with reference to
the Bavarian exchange, but would promise nothing as regards
Holland.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The cabinet then made proposals to Catherine on
the basis of her detaching Austria from France, and the formation
of a triple alliance between England and the two imperial
courts for the maintenance of peace.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Catherine replied that she
would only agree on condition that England would not assent
to the F&uuml;rstenbund, which was a menace to her Austrian ally.
Her demand was peremptory and threatening. George stood
firm. The F&uuml;rstenbund, he wrote to Pitt, concerned his "electoral
capacity," it was a matter of Hanoverian, not of English,
politics; he had already ratified it, and would not retreat.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> A
communication from the Prussian ambassador led the cabinet in
September to send Lord Cornwallis to Frederick to ascertain
his intentions. Frederick declared that the agreement between
himself and England to check France would mean a general
war in which England would have to meet the fleets of France,
Spain, Holland, and perhaps Russia; and he would have on
his hands the armies of France, Austria, and Russia; and
that "though such a contest had been maintained, it was not
a game to play often".<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> He was old and ill, and would not
interfere. The action of France in negotiating the treaty of
Fontainebleau strengthened the French party in Holland; the
stadholder was forced to quit the Hague, but was supported
by some of the other provinces. Frederick the Great died on
August 17, 1786. The fortunes of the Orange party were at
low ebb. France supplied the patriots with money; free corps
were acting on their side; the stadholder was suspended from
his office, and French agents advocated its abolition. It seemed
as though Holland would become mistress of the Dutch republic
and France the ruler of Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_243" id="TOPIC_243"></a>The new Prussian king, Frederick William II., the brother
of the Princess of Orange, deserted the purely German policy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of Frederick for a more extended European policy. He did
not, however, at once interfere in the affairs of Holland, for
there was a strong French party at his court. Harris needed
money to support the stadholder's cause, and Carmarthen proposed
a subvention of &pound;1,200 a year. George was anxious
not to be drawn into another war, and said that as his family
was growing expensive the money could not be spared from
the civil list.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> In May, 1787, the cabinet decided to put &pound;20,000
at Harris's disposal. Matters came to a crisis in June. As
the princess was on her way to the Hague she was arrested
and turned back by a free corps. Frederick William demanded
that satisfaction should be made for this insult, and as the states
of Holland, relying on French support, refused his demand, he
entered into a secret convention with England to restore the
stadholder, the two powers agreeing, Prussia to send an army
into Holland and England to prepare forty ships of the line to
support it. A Prussian army under the Duke of Brunswick
crossed the frontier and met with little resistance. Amsterdam
surrendered on October 10, and the stadholder was restored.
Meanwhile Montmorin, the French foreign minister, declared
that his court would support the Dutch. Pitt, who was then
personally directing foreign affairs, decided, with the full approval
of the king, that if the French court would not agree
to the restoration war was inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> A treaty was made with
the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel for the hire of troops, and the
naval and military forces were augmented. On the 27th France
definitely renounced her design of intervention, and on Pitt's
demand the French navy was reduced to a peace-footing. The
designs of France, which were fraught with danger to English
interests, were defeated, and the party in Holland favourable
to alliance with England was secured in power.<a name="TOPIC_244" id="TOPIC_244"></a> Though the
F&uuml;rstenbund, a purely German system directed against Austrian
ambition, failed to bring about an Anglo-Prussian alliance, the
change in Prussian policy and, as an immediate cause, the insult to
the Prussian king's sister, brought England and Prussia into active
co-operation against the attempt of France to become mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of the United Provinces, and in 1788 led to the formation of a
triple alliance for mutual defence and the maintenance of peace
between England, Prussia, and the republic which changed the
political situation. England was no longer isolated; she was
restored to her position of influence in the affairs of Europe.
Harris was created Baron Malmesbury as a reward for his
services at the Hague.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>THE REGENCY QUESTION.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_245" id="TOPIC_245"></a>The affairs of India, which played so large a part in raising
Pitt to power, brought him a question fraught with embarrassment.
Annoyed by reproofs sent out by the directors, and
harassed by opposition in his council, by the independent attitude
of the Madras government, and by difficulties arising
from the conduct of officials both at Benares and Lucknow,
Hastings in 1783 declared his intention of resigning office. His
hope that the cabinet would request him to remain with extended
powers was crushed by the speech with which Pitt
introduced his India bill, and he left India in February, 1785,
esteemed and honoured by the natives of all classes in the Bengal
government. His wife came to England a year earlier, and
though her conduct before her marriage with Hastings would
have debarred other ladies from appearing at so strictly moral
a court, she was received at St. James's, and the queen accepted
presents from her. On the return of Hastings the directors
thanked him for his eminent services, the king was gracious to
him, the chancellor, Thurlow, who was in the royal confidence,
was loud in his praise, and society generally smiled upon him.
Pitt was cold; there was much in his conduct which needed
defence. Preparations for an attack upon him were steadily
pursued. Burke found a useful ally in Francis, who gratified
his spite by giving him information to be used against his former
antagonist. Fox and the opposition as a party adopted Burke's
case. It was believed that Pitt would stand by Hastings in
order to please the king. If he did so, they could represent him
as shielding a criminal; if he joined in bringing him to trial, he
would incur the risk of offending the king and alienating many
of the supporters of the government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARGES AGAINST HASTINGS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_246" id="TOPIC_246"></a>During 1785 Burke went on accumulating facts which were
distorted by his fervent imagination. The delay of the attack
encouraged the friends of Hastings, and on the first day of the
session of 1786 his parliamentary agent, Major Scott, an ill-advised
person, challenged Burke to fulfil a pledge made the year
before that he would bring charges against him. In February
Burke announced that he would propose to impeach Hastings
before the lords, and in April exhibited charges against him.
Pitt insisted that a copy of them should be delivered to Hastings,
and that he should be heard in his defence before the house
voted upon them. Fox and Burke, who on every check to their
proceedings accused the government of a design to screen Hastings,
declared with much heat that Pitt's proposal was intended to
quash the accusation. The house, however, determined to hear
Hastings, and he read his defence, which occupied two days and
wearied his audience with a number of unfamiliar details. On
June 1 Burke moved the first charge, which related to the
Rohill&aacute; war, and was ably supported by Fox. Pitt took no
part in discussing the main subject of the debate. Dundas, the
most prominent member of the India board, though condemning
Hastings's conduct, refused to consider the war as affording
ground for a criminal charge; and said that, as an act of
parliament had subsequently reappointed Hastings as governor-general,
the house had condoned his previous conduct; and he
spoke of Hastings as "the saviour of India". The house rejected
the charge by 119 to 67.</p>

<p>The second charge, with reference to the treatment of the
r&aacute;j&aacute; of Benares, was moved by Fox with all his wonted ability.
A treasury note invited the supporters of the government to
vote against the motion. To the astonishment of all, and to
the consternation of his supporters, Pitt announced that he
agreed to the charge; he sharply criticised the misrepresentation
of Hastings's opponents, and conclusively maintained that the
r&aacute;j&aacute; was bound to furnish the troops and money demanded of
him, but he considered the fine imposed on him "exorbitant,
unjust, and tyrannical". Many of the government party voted
against him, but about fifty followed his lead and the charge
was accepted by 119 to 79. The next day Hastings attended
the court on the presentation of a magnificent diamond sent
by the niz&aacute;m to the king, whose acceptance of the present gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
rise to much ill-natured comment. Various motives have been
suggested for Pitt's decision. None appear adequate save the
most obvious and honourable one, that he acted in accordance
with his conscience. Though his decision took the house by
surprise, he clearly defined his attitude four months before: "he
was neither a determined friend or foe to Mr. Hastings, and
was resolved to support the principles of justice and equity".<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
He did not read the papers relating to Benares until the eve of
the debate, and then, Dundas says, after reading them along
with Hastings's defence, Pitt and he agreed that they could not
resist the charge. The king in a friendly note gave Pitt credit
for acting conscientiously, adding that for his part he did not
think it possible in India "to carry on publick business with
the same moderation that is suitable to an European civilized
nation".<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> George was an eminently sensible man. There was
no split between him and his minister.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_247" id="TOPIC_247"></a>In February, 1787, Sheridan brought forward the third
charge, relating to the treatment of the begams of Oudh in a
speech held by all who heard it to be a marvellous display of
oratory. He described Hastings as "by turns a Dionysius and
a Scapin," a tyrant and a trickster, with a mind in which "all
was shuffling, ambiguous, dark, insidious, and little".<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Indeed
throughout the proceedings against Hastings his accusers constantly
disregarded moderation and even decency of language.
The third charge and other articles having been accepted by the
commons, Burke, on May 11, impeached Hastings of high crimes
and misdemeanours. An attempt was also made to bring an
impeachment against Sir Elijah Impey, lately chief-justice of
Bengal, on the ground of the execution of Nanda-Kum&aacute;r and
on other charges, but the commons, having heard his defence,
refused to agree to the articles. The trial of Warren Hastings
before the lords was opened in Westminster hall on February
13, 1788, with circumstances of dignity and splendour worthy
of so great an occasion. Burke's speech on the case for the
prosecution lasted for four days; it remains a magnificent specimen
of rhetoric, though its vehement denunciations founded on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
occurrences in which the accused was not directly concerned,
and its attempts to create prejudice were not likely to affect the
opinions of men conscious of their responsibility as judges. The
court sat during that session of parliament for thirty-five, and
in 1789 for seventeen days. It became evident that the trial
would last a long time and public interest in it soon flagged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORNWALLIS GOVERNOR-GENERAL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_248" id="TOPIC_248"></a>Cornwallis was chosen by Pitt in 1786 as governor-general
of India under the new act, and assumed the government in
1788. Unfettered by his council, he was in a far better position
than Hastings, and, in spite of many difficulties arising from
abuses of long standing, he effected numerous reforms both in
the civil and military services of the company during the first
three years of his administration. Meanwhile Tip&uacute;, encouraged
by his success in the late war and by the negligence of
the Madras government, was preparing for another attempt to
drive the English out of the Karnatic. He attacked their ally,
the r&aacute;j&aacute; of Travancore, in 1789. Cornwallis secured the alliance
of the niz&aacute;m and the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s in 1790, and General
Medows, the new governor of Madras, successfully invaded
Mysore. As, however, no further progress was made, Cornwallis
assumed the command; he carried Bangalore by storm
in March, 1791, and having obtained the active co-operation
of the niz&aacute;m and the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s, laid siege to Seringapatam in
1792, and compelled Tip&uacute; to submit to a peace by which he
surrendered half his dominions, engaged to pay a sum equal
to &pound;3,600,000, and gave two of his sons as hostages. The
surrendered territory was divided between the peishw&aacute; and the
niz&aacute;m. Tip&uacute;'s power was effectually broken, and the way was
prepared for his final overthrow seven years later. Cornwallis
was created a marquis as a reward for his splendid services,
and resigned his office in 1793.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_249" id="TOPIC_249"></a>Though the government escaped the dangers in which the
impeachment of Hastings threatened to involve it, a new question
relating to India brought it into some peril. When, in
October, 1787, war seemed likely to arise out of the intervention
of England in the affairs of the Dutch republic, the India
board sent four regiments to India, a measure of precaution
which met with the full approval of the directors. The storm-clouds
dispersed, and then the directors objected to pay the
expense. Pitt held that the company was bound by the act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
of 1784 to pay for the transport and maintenance of any troops
which the board judged to be necessary for the defence of the
British possessions in India, and brought in a declaratory bill
to that effect in February, 1788. The opposition was supported
by the influence of the company, and made a vigorous resistance.
Fox, whose downfall as minister had followed his attack on
the company, appeared as a champion of its claims. The
directors were heard by their counsel, one of whom, Erskine,
afterwards lord chancellor, a strong whig, made a violent attack
on Pitt. On the other side, Scott, also (as Lord Eldon) a future
chancellor, contended as a member of the house that the bill
was a true exposition of the act. The debate on the committal
lasted till 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Pitt had drunk heavily with Dundas the night
before, and was too unwell towards the end of the debate to
reply to his opponents. His majority of 57 was considered
unsatisfactory, and so many of the regular supporters of government
were adverse or lukewarm that an ultimate defeat was
thought probable. With great tact he two days later adopted
some amendments which met the chief arguments of the opposition
without injuring the principle of the bill.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The danger
was over, and the bill finally passed both houses. A severer
conflict and a more signal triumph were at hand.</p>

<p>The retirement of the aged chief-justice, Lord Mansfield, in
the June of that year, was followed by some legal appointments,
which included those of Pitt's personal friend, Pepper Arden,
as master of the rolls, and Scott as solicitor-general. Thurlow,
who was annoyed by Pitt's assent to the impeachment of Hastings,
strongly objected to Arden's appointment. The king
tried to make peace between him and Pitt. Thurlow was
forced to yield, and remained sulky and hostile. About the
same time Howe, the first lord of the admiralty, who was constantly
attacked with reference to matters which arose out of
the reduction of the navy consequent on the peace, resigned
office, because he considered that Pitt did not afford him
adequate support. He was created an English earl on his retirement.
In his place Pitt put his own elder brother Chatham,
a favourite with the king, but, as it proved, an indolent and
inefficient minister, and also appointed Hood to a seat on the
new admiralty board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AFFAIRS OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_250" id="TOPIC_250"></a>For the most part things were going well with the king.
He rejoiced in the successes of his ministers, and his victory
over the coalition brought him popularity such as he had not
enjoyed since his accession. His popularity was heightened
by an attempt to stab him made by an insane woman named
Margaret Nicholson on August 2, 1786. The poor woman was
sent to Bedlam. George, who behaved with the utmost calmness,
escaped unhurt, and the manifestations of loyalty evoked
by the incident deeply gratified him. He was, however, much
troubled by the ill conduct of the Prince of Wales. The prince
drank, gambled, betted, and was addicted to debauchery; he
showed no sense of honour in his dealings either with men or
women, was thoroughly mean and selfish, and consorted with
low companions. He was outrageously extravagant, and, in
addition to the large sums lavished on his ordinary expenses,
incurred enormous liabilities in altering and decorating his
residence, Carlton house. The arrangement of his affairs in
1783 was not on a scale sufficient to meet his expenditure.
By August, 1784, he was so deeply in debt that he informed
his father that he intended to leave England and live abroad.
George insisted that he should give up this scheme, which would
have implied a public breach, and said that if he expected help
he should send him a full statement of his debts and some assurance
that he would keep within his income in the future.
The prince was unwilling to send details of his debts, and when
Sir James Harris tried to persuade him to please his father by
ceasing to identify himself with the opposition and by marrying,
declared that he could not give up "Charles" [Fox] and his
other friends, and that he would never marry. When at last
he sent his father the required statement, it showed liabilities
amounting to &pound;269,000, of which &pound;79,700 was for completing
the work at Carlton house. George was very angry, and the
prince finding that his father would not help him stopped the
work, dismissed his court officers, and sold his stud. There was
an open quarrel between the father and son. "The king hates
me," the prince said, and he did not consider how grievously he
had provoked his father.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>His friends wished to obtain the payment of his debts from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
parliament, but were embarrassed by the report that he was
secretly married to Mrs. Fitzherbert, a beautiful and virtuous
lady, six years older than himself, who at twenty-seven was left
a widow for the second time. After repeated solicitations,
unmanly exhibitions of despair, and a pretended attempt at
suicide, he had persuaded her to accept his offer of marriage,
and they were married privately before witnesses by a clergyman
of the established Church on December 21, 1785. This
was a most serious matter, for Mrs. Fitzherbert was a Roman
catholic, and the act of settlement provided that marriage with
a papist constituted an incapacity to inherit the crown, while on
the other hand the royal marriage act of 1772 rendered the
prince's marriage invalid. In April, 1787, his friends in the
house of commons took steps towards seeking the payment of
his debts from the house. Pitt refused to move in the matter
without the king's commands, and, notice of a motion for an
address to the crown on the subject having been given, declared
that he would meet it with "an absolute negative". In the
course of debate, Rolle, a member for Devonshire, alluded to
the reported marriage as a matter of danger to the Church
and state. Fox explicitly denied the truth of the report, and on
being pressed declared that he spoke from "direct authority".
There is no doubt that he did so, and that the prince lied.
Mrs. Fitzherbert was cruelly wounded, and in order to satisfy
her the prince asked Grey to say something in the house which
would convey the impression that Fox had gone too far. Grey
peremptorily refused to throw a doubt on Fox's veracity, and
the prince had to employ a meaner instrument: "Sheridan
must say something". Accordingly, Sheridan in a speech in
the house, while not insinuating that Fox had spoken without
the prince's authority, "uttered some unintelligible sentimental
trash about female delicacy".<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Fox was indignant at the way
in which the prince had treated him, and is said to have refused
to speak to him for more than a year; but he evidently did not
consider the prince's conduct such as ought to prevent him from
again acting with him, and in about a year they appear to have
been as friendly as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>The denial of the prince's marriage was generally accepted.
Pitt saw that there was a strong feeling that he ought to be
relieved from his difficulties, and determined to anticipate a
motion to that effect. He and Dundas arranged terms between
the father and son. George agreed that the prince should receive
an addition to his income of &pound;10,000 a year from the
civil list, and that a royal message should be sent to the
commons requesting the payment of his debts; and he demanded
that the prince should promise not to get into debt
again. The promise was given, and a reference to it was inserted
in the king's message. The commons, without a division,
voted &pound;161,000 for the payment of the debts and &pound;20,000 for
the completion of Carlton house. The father and son were
reconciled, and appeared together in public. In spite of his
protestations the prince did not amend his conduct. Early in
1788 he still took an active part with the opposition, and set
up a gambling club, where he lost heavily. His example was
followed by his younger brother Frederick, Duke of York.
The duke, then a lieutenant-general, after receiving a military
education in Germany, returned home in 1787, and lived a very
fast life with so little regard to decency that "his company was
thought <i>mauvais ton</i>".<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S INSANITY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_251" id="TOPIC_251"></a>On November 5, 1788, the king, who for some time had
been in bad health, became decidedly insane. At first it was
believed that his life was in immediate danger, and that, even if
he was spared, he would not recover his reason. The Prince of
Wales stayed at Windsor, and assumed charge of the king's
person, and it was universally recognised that he must be
regent. Whether the king died or remained insane, Pitt's dismissal
seemed certain, for not only was the prince closely allied
with the opposition, but he was deeply offended at the line Pitt
had taken with reference to his debts. The hopes of the opposition
ran high. Fox, who was travelling in Italy with his
mistress, Mrs. Armistead, was sent for in hot haste. In his
absence Sheridan, whose convivial habits made him acceptable
to the prince, busied himself with the affairs of the party. If
they came into power Loughborough had an undoubted claim
to the chancellorship. Thurlow, however, was ready to betray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
his colleagues if he were assured that he should retain his office.
The prince and Sheridan arranged that he should have his
price, and he secretly joined them. From the first Pitt decided
on his course; the prince must be appointed regent by act of
parliament, with such limitations as would secure the king, should
he recover, from being hampered in the exercise of his rights.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
For himself, embarrassed as his private affairs were, he looked
forward calmly to the loss of office, and determined to practise
as a barrister. According to the last prorogation, parliament
was to meet on the 20th. The king's insanity rendered a further
prorogation impossible; parliament met, and Pitt procured an
adjournment until December 4, to see how it would go with
the king.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fox returned home and unwillingly agreed to
the arrangement with Thurlow. The chancellor's colleagues
were convinced that he betrayed their counsels, and one day
when the cabinet met at Windsor, the fact that he had first had
a private interview with the prince was disclosed through the
loss of his hat; "I suppose," he growled, "I left it in the other
place," the prince's apartment.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Pitt wisely took no notice of
his treachery. On the 3rd the king's physicians were examined
by the privy council; they stated that he was mentally incapable,
that they believed that his illness was curable, and that
they could not say how long it might continue. The opposition
was anxious to make the worst of matters, for if the illness was
likely to be a long one, it would be difficult to refuse the regent
full powers. Accordingly, on the 4th, Fox urged that the
physicians should be examined by a committee of the house.
Pitt assented readily, for a new physician had been called in
who took a favourable view of the case. This was Willis, a
clergyman, who had become a doctor, and was a specialist in
insanity; he took chief charge of the king, who was removed to
Kew, pursued a new line of treatment, prohibited irritating restraints,
and controlled him by establishing influence over him.
He told the committee that he had found that such cases lasted
on an average five months, and at worst about eighteen; the
other doctors, though less hopeful, held that ultimate recovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
was probable. The ministers were ready to proceed, and
reckoned that another month would see the prince appointed
regent, and that their own dismissal would follow at once.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FOX ASSERTS THE PRINCE'S RIGHT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_252" id="TOPIC_252"></a>On the 10th Pitt moved for a committee to search for precedents.
Fox objected; it was not for parliament, he maintained,
to consider who should be regent; the Prince of Wales had a
clear right to the regency, and parliament was only qualified to
decide when he should exercise his right. When Pitt heard the
authority of parliament thus called in question, he is said to have
slapped his leg and to have exultantly exclaimed to the minister
sitting beside him, "I'll unwhig the gentleman for the rest of
his life!" He declared that Fox's doctrine was in the highest
degree unconstitutional, and that no part of the royal authority
could belong to the prince unless it was conferred on him by
parliament; the question, he told the house, concerned its right
of deliberation. Fox saw his mistake, and two days later stated
that the prince put forward no claim of right; both sides agreed
that he must be regent and that before he assumed the office he
must be invited to do so by parliament; his right was an abstract
question upon which it was no use to argue. Pitt was too good
a tactician to allow him to minimise the point at issue; he
denied "that the prince had any right whatever". The difference
between an irresistible claim, which Pitt acknowledged, and
an inherent right was not one merely of words; if the prince
could claim the regency as of right, parliament could not restrict
his power without his consent. The effect of Fox's false move was
heightened by the folly of Sheridan who raised a storm of indignation
by a threat of the danger of provoking the prince to assert
his claim. Once again Fox made Pitt the champion of the king
and the nation against the pretensions of a whig faction. The
character of the struggle was understood, and bills were posted
with the heading: "Fox for the prince's prerogative," and "Pitt
for the privilege of parliament and the liberties of the nation".
Yet in both houses several supporters of the government ratted,
for the prince seemed the rising sun, and he and the Duke of
York openly canvassed on Fox's side.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_253" id="TOPIC_253"></a>Nevertheless the commons approved Pitt's resolutions to the
effect that, as the personal exercise of the royal authority was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
interrupted, it was the duty of the two houses to supply the defect,
and that it was necessary to determine on means by which
the royal assent might be given to bills for that purpose. None
of the precedents adduced by the committee met the present
case. Fox argued that to appoint a regent by a law was to
treat the monarchy as elective, and that the two houses had
no legislative power independently of the crown; and assuming
that he was about to re-enter on office taunted the ministers
with a design to weaken their successors by limiting the powers
of the regent. The ministerial majority was 268 to 204. Pitt
proposed to provide for the royal assent by placing the great
seal in a commission with authority to affix it to the bill. This
daring fiction, the only means by which a regency could be
established by enactment, was approved by 251 to 178. On
this question, and throughout the whole course of the struggle,
Burke spoke with a violence and impropriety which injured his
party and suggested a disordered mind. He called Pitt the
prince's competitor, referred to the chancellor as Priapus and
as "a man with a large black brow and a big wig," and later
disgusted the house by speaking of the king as "hurled from
his throne" by the Almighty. In the lords the proceedings
followed the same lines as in the commons. Willis's account of
the king convinced Thurlow that he was playing a wrong game,
and when the question of the prince's right was discussed in
the lords' he spoke strongly on the government side. Several
members of the lower house were present to hear him. He
referred to the favours he had received from the king, "When
I forget them," he said, "may God forget me!" "Forget you!"
said Wilkes with exquisite wit, "He will see you damned first."
"The best thing that can happen to you," said Burke. Pitt left
the house exclaiming, "Oh, the rascal!" On the 25th Thurlow
formally severed his connexion with Fox. After a warm debate
the ministerial resolutions were affirmed by the lords by 99 to
66.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESTRICTIONS ON THE REGENT'S POWER.</i></div>

<p>The restrictions which the cabinet proposed to place on the
power of the regent were laid before the prince. He was to be
debarred from conferring peerages except on the king's issue of
full age; from granting reversions or any office or pension except
during pleasure, and from disposing of the king's property;
and the charge of the king's person and the management of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
household were to be in the queen's hands. These restrictions
were based on the idea that the king would speedily recover;
if his illness was prolonged they were to be open to revision by
parliament. The prince promised to accept the regency, and
stated his objections to the restrictions. The existence of the
government seemed drawing to an end. Pitt was extremely
popular, and the London merchants, expecting that he would
soon be driven from office, offered him a gift of &pound;100,000, which
he declined to accept. Before he could bring the restrictions
before the commons, the speaker, Cornwall, died, and on January
5, 1789, William Wyndham Grenville, joint-paymaster of the
forces, was elected in his place. A fresh examination of the
physicians was urged by the opposition. Willis told the committee
that good progress was made; Dr. Warren's account was
less favourable. Willis was represented by the prince's party as
a charlatan, and Warren was pitted against him as the doctor of
the opposition. After this delay Pitt laid the restrictions before
the house as resolutions. They certainly impaired the power of
the executive, and would have weakened any ministry appointed
by the regent. No exact date was fixed for their duration, and
it is conceivable that, after the regency had lasted for some years,
the upper house would have refused to remove the restriction as
to the creation of peers, and would, as in 1719, have attempted
to limit their number by withholding from the regent a part of
the royal prerogative. And as the management of the household
would have placed a patronage of over &pound;80,000 a year<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
at the disposal of the queen, who was hostile to Fox, a court
influence might have been established in favour of Pitt and
adverse to the new ministry. The queen was accused of intrigue
and violently attacked by the opposition press. Fox
urged his objections to the resolutions with much force, but
they were adopted by both houses, and on the 31st the prince
accepted the offer of the regency made by the lords and commons
on those terms, on the understanding that the restrictions
were temporary.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_254" id="TOPIC_254"></a>His party was in high glee; medals were struck to commemorate
his regency, whig ladies wore regency caps and ribbons,
and a list of new ministers was drawn up. The conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
of the prince and the Duke of York caused much scandal.
Stories of the ill-treatment of the king while in the prince's
charge may be dismissed as unfounded; it is alleged that the
prince made sport of his father's ravings, it is certain that his
associates did so, and that he and his brother behaved with
brutal callousness and openly indulged in riotous merry-making
during the king's illness.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Before the resolutions could be made
law it was thought that a formal opening of parliament was
necessary in order to invest it with legislative capacity, and this
was effected on February 3 by a commission under the great
seal. Pitt then brought in the regency bill, and while it was
before the commons, agreed that all restriction should terminate
in three years if the king remained ill so long. The bill passed
the commons after warm debate, and had reached the committee
stage in the lords when, on the 19th, the king was declared
to be convalescent. His recovery progressed steadily, and on
March 10 he announced to parliament, through commissioners,
his complete restoration to health. Both on that night, and on
April 23, when he returned thanks in St. Paul's, there were
great rejoicings, for his illness enshrined him in the hearts of
his people. The skill and temper which Pitt exhibited throughout
the long crisis strengthened his position in parliament and
his place in the esteem of the public, and from that time more
cordial relations were established between him and the king,
who warmly acknowledged his obligations to him. Though he
was fortunate in the king's timely recovery, he owed much also
to Fox's bad management. The hasty assertion of the prince's
rights and the delays interposed in the proceedings in the
commons put off the settlement of the regency until it was no
longer needed, while the attack on the authority of parliament
on behalf of the prince's prerogative and the reckless attempt
of Fox and his party to displace a ministry which had the
confidence of the nation, in order to obtain office for themselves,
brought general censure upon them and added to Pitt's
popularity.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_255" id="TOPIC_255"></a>In Ireland the parliament met in 1789 when the regency
question was still before the English parliament. Buckingham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
who as Earl Temple was lord-lieutenant in 1782-83, had succeeded
Rutland in 1787. He hoped that the Irish would adopt
the English plan. He was disappointed by their extreme
jealousy of anything which might look like dependence. The
functions of the viceroy rendered the question of restrictions of
little importance, and, under the guidance of Grattan, an address
was voted inviting the prince to assume the regency of the
kingdom without limitations. Buckingham refused to forward
it on the ground that it purported to invest the prince with a
power not conferred on him by law; for the prince could not
lawfully take any part of the royal authority without an act of
parliament, and no Irish bill could be enacted without the royal
assent under the great seal. The cabinet approved of his
refusal. The parliament sent commissioners over with the
address; but by the time that it was presented the king was
virtually recovered, and the matter ended ineffectually. No
serious consequences probably would in any case have arisen
from the course adopted by the Irish parliament, but the difference
between the two countries on so important a question
enforced the need of a legislative union. Soon after the conclusion
of this business Sydney resigned the home office. He
differed from Pitt on the slave trade question, and Pitt was
probably glad to get a colleague more thoroughly at one with
him. He was succeeded by William Grenville on June 5, and
Henry Addington was elected speaker in Grenville's place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION BEGINS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_256" id="TOPIC_256"></a>In the summer news of a revolution arrived from Paris.
The reforming movement, in which all European states had
some share, was promoted in France by ideas of constitutional
government borrowed from England, by the attacks of Voltaire
on medievalism and religious authority, by the advance of
science, by the teaching of the encyclop&aelig;dists, by the exaltation
of individual liberty by political economists, by Rousseau's
romantic theories on the foundations of society, and by sympathy
with the American revolution. It was supplied with practical
aims by the misery of the poor, the injustice done to the lower
classes, which alone paid the heaviest of the taxes, the privileges
of the nobles and clergy, the harshness of the laws, and
arbitrary methods of government. England, as we have seen,
shared in the reforming movement. Here, however, it had no
such violent results as in France. No sharp lines divided class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
from class; the laws were the same for all, there was no difference
in taxation, and no privileged caste, for a peer's younger
sons were commoners, as was his eldest son so long as his father
lived. Parliamentary and other free institutions, imperfect as
they were, secured the liberties of the people. The life of the
agricultural poor though hard was not intolerable; landowners
lived upon their estates and directed local affairs, and the poor
were at least kept from starvation. France was almost bankrupt,
ruined by the prodigality of her two last kings and their
neglect of their duties to their people. Louis XVI. was forced
to summon the states-general, which met at Versailles on May
4, 1789. Political discontent was rife and was rendered dangerous
by the distress of the poor; the winter had been hard,
prices were rising, and Paris was full of destitute persons, of
labourers out of work, and along with them a large number of
criminals and ruffians.</p>

<p>The deputies of the "third estate," who were about equal
in number to those of the two privileged orders and were supported
by a few nobles and a large minority of the clergy, demanded
that the three estates should form a single chamber.
The king upheld the privileged orders in their refusal. The
third estate voted itself a "national assembly," and, after a
struggle of six weeks, gained its point, and the estates were
constituted as a single assembly. Paris was in a ferment of
excitement. The king dismissed Necker, the minister of finance,
who was trusted by the popular party, and refused to withdraw
his troops from the city. A riot broke out, and on July 14
the Bastille, an ancient fortress and prison, then little used,
which was guarded by a few Swiss and some old soldiers or
<i>invalides</i>, was taken by the mob, and the governor and some
others were murdered. The king's brother, the Count of
Artois, the Prince of Cond&eacute;, and several unpopular nobles
fled from France. A new municipality was established and
Lafayette was chosen to command a new civic militia or
national guard. Disorder and rioting prevailed in the provinces,
country-houses were burnt and pillaged, and many
murders were committed. Louis was forced to assent to all
the demands of the people; he recalled Necker, and showed
himself at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville wearing the national cockade
or tricolour. The assembly voted decrees sweeping away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
feudal system, abolishing the privileges of classes and corporations,
and ecclesiastical tithes, and promulgated a flatulent
declaration of the rights of man. Bread-riots broke out in
Paris on October 5; a mob marched on Versailles and invaded
the palace, and on the 6th the national guard brought the king
and queen to Paris, where they remained in virtual captivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLISH OPINIONS ON EVENTS IN FRANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_257" id="TOPIC_257"></a>The first tidings of the movement were received in England
with satisfaction. It was generally believed that the insurrection
would shortly end in the establishment of constitutional government,
that while the troubles lasted France would cease to be
formidable, and that consequently a continuance of peace and
relief from taxation might be expected. Before long, however,
the acts of violence and the spoliation effected by the decrees
of the assembly roused widespread disgust. As late as February,
1790, Pitt, while stigmatising the liberty proclaimed in
France as "absolute slavery," believed that the commotions
would end in order and true liberty. Burke from the first held
that the outburst of "Parisian ferocity" proved that it was
doubtful whether the French were fit for liberty; he maintained
that, though the power of France might cease to be formidable,
its example was to be dreaded, and expressed his abhorrence
of the destruction of the institutions of the kingdom. Fox, on
the other hand, as he had delighted in the American revolution,
delighted in the revolution in France. Of the fall of the Bastille,
which had made hardly any impression on French public opinion,
he wrote: "How much the greatest event it is that has happened
in the world; and how much the best!" While he regretted
the bloodshed which accompanied the revolution, he constantly
declared his exultation in its successes. A comparatively small
party of democrats, supported by the political dissenters under the
leadership of the Unitarian ministers Price and Priestley, noisily
expressed their sympathy with the French democrats; and some
men of high position, such as Lords Stanhope and Lansdowne,
professed more or less republican principles. The revolution
society under the presidency of Stanhope sent an address to
the French assembly, and clubs were formed in many large
towns "avowedly affiliated to the democratic clubs in France".<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The difference between Burke and Fox on this matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
was openly declared in the debate on the army estimates in
February, 1790. Fox in a mischievous speech referred to the
part taken by the French army in forwarding the revolution,
and said that it was a time when he should be least jealous
of an increase in the army, since the example of France had
shown that "a man by becoming a soldier did not cease to be
a citizen". Burke declared that France was setting an example
of anarchy, fraud, violence, and atheism, and that the worst part
of its example was the interference in civil affairs of "base
hireling mutineers" who deserted their officers "to join a
furious licentious populace". He protested against a comparison
between the revolution in France and the revolution
of 1688, between the conduct of the soldiery on that occasion
and the behaviour of some of the French troops. His speech,
which was received with general applause, had a strong effect
on opinion, and Pitt and others expressed their agreement with
it. Fox answered him in a conciliatory tone. Sheridan fanned
the flame; he taunted Burke with inconsistency, and pronounced
a panegyric on the revolutionary leaders. Burke replied that
thenceforth he and Sheridan were separated in politics. A rift
in the opposition was started, and an attempt to close it by
a conference two days later was ineffectual. The opinion of
parliament on two other questions during the session was,
seemingly, influenced by events in France. Fox renewed the
attack on the test acts. He was opposed by Pitt; and Burke,
whose speech, Fox said, filled him "with grief and shame,"
animadverted on the overthrow of the Church in France, and
maintained that Price, Priestley, and other dissenters hoped to
overthrow the Church of England. Fox's motion was defeated
by 294 to 105. A motion for parliamentary reform by Flood,
who then represented an English constituency, was opposed
by Pitt, Windham, and Burke, and was rejected without a
division. The session ended on June 10, and parliament was
dissolved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SPANISH CLAIM TO NOOTKA SOUND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_258" id="TOPIC_258"></a>England reaped material benefit from the temporary extinction
of France as a factor in the affairs of Europe, consequent
on the proceedings of the assembly. Some difficulties with
Spain had been removed by a convention arranged in 1786,
by which Great Britain agreed to withdraw the settlers from
the Mosquito coast, and the Spanish king allowed them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
occupy a district in Honduras. As this compliance on the part
of England checked the smuggling of goods into the Spanish
colonies, it was well received by Spain. Hostile feelings towards
England soon revived. Florida Blanca, the Spanish minister,
was anxious to increase trade with the colonies, and was determined
to keep it exclusively for the mother-country. It
was impossible to prevent English ships from interfering with
it. The colonies of Spanish America were discontented; some
insurrections had been made with the object of gaining direct
trade with other nations, and the malcontents hoped for help
from England.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Florida Blanca believed that England sought
first to establish direct commercial communication with her
Spanish American colonies, and, finally, to separate them from
the mother-country.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He was determined to prevent these
designs, which had no existence in England, and was upheld
in his purpose by the extravagant opinion held by himself and
his nation as to the strength of their country. He found his
opportunity in 1789. Some English merchants had established
a settlement at Nootka Sound, off Vancouver's island, for trade
in furs and ginseng with China. In April one of their ships
with its cargo was seized in the Sound by a Spanish frigate, the
officers and crew were maltreated, and two more ships were
seized shortly afterwards. Satisfaction was demanded by the
English government, and was refused by Spain on the grounds
that all lands on the west coast of America as far as 60&deg; north
latitude were under the dominion of Spain, and further that
Nootka belonged to Spain, because it had been discovered and
occupied by a Spanish captain four years before Cook visited
those coasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONVENTION WITH SPAIN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_259" id="TOPIC_259"></a>The English government held that these pretensions were

his court.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The affair was kept secret in England until May 3,
when the preparations of Spain demanded immediate action.
On that day an order in council was passed for pressing seamen
in every port in the kingdom, and the commons unanimously
agreed to a vote of credit of &pound;1,000,000 for expenses. The
matter was laid before the two other members of the triple
alliance; the Dutch at once fitted out a squadron to act with
the British fleet, and a favourable answer was received from
the Prussian king. The French ministers, moved by the news
of the naval preparations of Great Britain, and expecting to
be called on to fulfil the obligation expressed in the family
compact, ordered the armament of fourteen ships of the line.
On this the national assembly voted that it had the right to
decide on questions of war, and on May 22 declared that the
French nation renounced wars of conquest. This grandiloquent
decree destroyed the effect of the armament. Nevertheless,
Spain was set on war; fleets were gathered at Ferrol and
Cadiz, and a loan of &pound;4,000,000 was arranged. Florida Blanca
seems to have relied on help from the United States, and made
some efforts to gain their good-will, but they did not respond
to them.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> From France he peremptorily demanded the assistance
to which Louis was pledged by the family compact. His
demand was laid before the national assembly, and on August
25 it was decided to substitute a new <i>pacte national</i> for the
<i>pacte de famille</i>, and to invite the king to arm forty-five ships
for defence, and to revise the treaty; and a suggestion was
made to Spain that she might confirm the new compact by
the cession of Louisiana. This was mere folly. The English
ministers notified the French government that any help given
to Spain would be promptly resented,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and Florida Blanca
seeing that no reliance was to be placed on France entered
into negotiations with England. During their progress a fresh
cause of offence was given to England; for in September
McDonald, captain of a British West Indiaman, reported that
his ship had been stopped by a Spanish frigate in the Gulf of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Florida, that he had been forced to go aboard the Spaniard,
and had there been cruelly tortured, being set in the bilboes in
the blazing sun.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> For this outrage satisfaction was promptly
made, and on October 28 a treaty was signed between Great
Britain and Spain by which Spain yielded to the demands of
the British court with reference to the Nootka Sound affair
and restored the disputed territory. The submission of Spain
marks a complete change in her policy; she sought by compliance
towards England to gain the security no longer to be
looked for from alliance with France. It was a signal triumph
for Pitt, who as usual had directed the proceedings of the
foreign office, for Carmarthen, who succeeded his father as
Duke of Leeds in 1789, was a feeble person. Pitt had broken
up the family compact and could reckon on the compliance of
Spain. France was isolated and had exhibited her weakness
before the eyes of Europe. The despicable proceedings of the
national assembly saved England from a war, and dissolved
the alliance which had so long threatened her.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>DECLARATION OF WAR BY FRANCE.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_260" id="TOPIC_260"></a>For the sake of clearness it will be convenient in this chapter
to notice first some matters of domestic interest debated in
parliament from 1790 to 1792, next to take a general view of
English foreign policy, and, lastly, to trace the effects of the
French revolution on English politics down to the outbreak of
the war with France. The general election of 1790 proved that
Pitt had thoroughly gained the confidence of the nation, for it
increased his already large majority. The election presented
one noteworthy incident; Horne Tooke, though in holy orders,
and consequently supposed to be disqualified, presented himself
for election at Westminster; he retired before the close
of the poll, and the question of the qualification of clergymen to
sit in parliament was not decided until 1801. In consequence
of the hostility of the chancellor, Pitt needed some one to lead
his party in the lords, and chose William Grenville, the secretary
of state for home affairs, who was created Baron Grenville.
The expenses of the armament against Spain amounted to
nearly &pound;3,000,000; the prosperity of the country warranted
Pitt's decision not to allow any interruption in the progress of
the reduction of debt; he obtained &pound;500,000 from the Bank
of England without interest, on the strength of unclaimed
dividends, and proposed to obtain the remainder by taxation.
<a name="TOPIC_261" id="TOPIC_261"></a>The question was raised whether the dissolution put an end to
the prosecution of Hastings. That an impeachment was not
"abated" by a dissolution had been affirmed by the lords in
the case of Lord Danby in 1679, but this decision was reversed
in 1685. Precedents were obscure, and the great lawyers differed.
Pitt, who on this question sided with Fox and Burke,
argued on broad constitutional grounds that an act of the crown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
should not hinder the commons in the exercise of a right, and
it was agreed by both houses that an impeachment should remain
<i>in statu quo</i> from one parliament to another. The trial
was resumed in 1791. After lasting for seven years it ended
in 1795 in the acquittal of the accused on every count. The
decision was generally approved. If in the midst of extraordinary
difficulties Hastings did some things hard to justify,
he was at the least a great ruler, firm, self-reliant, patient, and
enlightened, who served his country well. He lived until 1818,
honoured in his old age.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT ON THE SLAVE TRADE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_262" id="TOPIC_262"></a>The relief granted to English Roman catholics in 1778
was extended in 1791. Though they were still precluded
from sitting in parliament and holding public offices, a bill
introduced by John Mitford, afterwards Lord Redesdale, gave
complete freedom of worship and education, admission to the
legal profession, and exemption from vexatious liabilities to all
catholics who took an oath of an unobjectionable character.
Pitt approved of the bill, and Fox supported it, though he
wished that it had gone further, and declared his dislike of all
tests. A bill placing Scottish catholics in virtually the same
position as their co-religionists in England was passed in 1793.
The confiscation of Church property in France strengthened
the unwillingness of the commons to weaken the position of
the Church at home. A motion to relieve the Scottish presbyterians
from the obligation of the test act was lost by a large
majority, and a motion for the relief of unitarians, which must
be noticed later, also failed. Since 1789 Wilberforce had been
working on a committee for collecting evidence with respect
to the slave trade. In 1791 he made a motion for its abolition
which was supported both by Pitt and Fox, but was defeated
by 163 to 88. He repeated his motion in 1792. The king
had at first favoured the cause, but a shocking massacre of the
white population in the French portion of St. Domingo by the
negroes, who were excited by the preaching of the "rights of
man," turned him against it, and he thenceforward regarded
abolition as jacobinical. Thurlow, Hawkesbury, and Dundas
were strongly opposed to it. Pitt could not, therefore, make
it a government measure without almost certainly wrecking his
administration. He supported the motion with a speech of surpassing
eloquence. Public opinion made a direct negative no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
longer possible; but the West India merchants and planters and
the shipping interest were powerful, and the anti-abolitionists
were strengthened by the king's known dislike to the cause.
The motion was met by arguments for delay, and an amendment
proposed by Dundas for gradual abolition was carried.
A resolution was finally adopted that the trade should cease in
1796. The lords postponed the question. Year after year Wilberforce,
supported by James Stephen, Zachary Macaulay, and
others, carried on the struggle for the abolition of the trade with
noble persistency. The victory was not attained until 1807.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_263" id="TOPIC_263"></a>Another measure on which Pitt and Fox were also in full
accord was more successful. Lord Mansfield's pronouncement in
the action against Almon, the bookseller, in 1770, which reserved
the question of the criminality of a libel for the decision of the
court, was, it will be remembered, widely condemned as an invasion
of the rights of jurors. Of late years these rights had
successfully been maintained by the famous advocate Erskine.
When, for example, in 1789, in consequence of a motion by Fox,
a publisher, Stockdale, was prosecuted by the crown for a libel
on the promoters of the trial of Hastings, Erskine contended
that the whole pamphlet in question should be considered by
the jury, and procured an acquittal. Fox, who in his early days
had jeered at the rights of jurors, introduced a bill in 1791 declaring
their right to give a general verdict in a case of libel.
His speech was one of his finest; he was ably seconded by
Erskine; Pitt gave him his aid, and the bill was passed unanimously
by the commons. Thurlow, who disliked the bill, prevailed
on the lords to postpone it until the next session. When
it was again sent up by the commons in 1792, he obtained a
delay until the judges should have been consulted. Their
opinion, though hesitating, was unfavourable to the bill. The
aged Camden, however, spoke strongly in its favour, and it was
carried in spite of the chancellor's opposition. This statute, of
which Fox, Erskine, and Pitt share the credit, placed the liberty
of the press in the hands of jurors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EUROPEAN POLITICS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_264" id="TOPIC_264"></a>From 1788 Pitt's foreign policy was directed towards the
pacification of Europe and the maintenance of the balance of
power by means of the triple alliance between Great Britain,
Prussia, and Holland. Catherine of Russia, who was bent on
the overthrow of the Turkish empire, and on strengthening her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
hold on Poland, pressed the Turks until they declared war in
1787. The next year the emperor Joseph declared war against
them. Gustavus III. of Sweden allied himself with the Turks
and invaded Finland. His expedition failed, and Denmark, the
ally of Russia, invaded his kingdom. Sweden was in imminent
danger; its overthrow would have given Russia absolute sway
in the Baltic; the commerce of England and Holland would
have been seriously affected, and the coast of Prussia endangered.
The allied powers interfered, and a threat that
Prussia would invade Holstein, and a British fleet sail for the
Sound, compelled Denmark to cease hostilities, and saved the
independence of Sweden. Catherine was deeply offended, and
when the allies offered to mediate a peace between her and the
Turks, returned a decided refusal. She pressed on the war
with success, and the capture of Ochakov extended her dominions
to the Dniester.</p>

<p>The emperor's war was unsuccessful. He was in great
difficulties; for Hungary was restless and his Netherland provinces
in revolt. The allies might have mediated a peace
between him and the Turks on the basis of the <i>status quo</i>
before the war, had it not been for the desire of Frederick
William to use the difficulties of Austria for his own advantage.
He designed to compel Austria to a peace by which she should
restore Galicia to Poland, in order that in return Poland should
cede to him Dantzig and Thorn; and he would have compensated
Austria by allowing the emperor to conquer and retain
Moldavia and Walachia. He hoped to accomplish this through
his alliance with England and Holland, and in order further to
weaken Austria proposed that the revolted Netherlands should
be united to Holland as one republic, urging that they might
otherwise fall into the hands of France. Pitt desired to arrange
a peace on the <i>status quo</i> basis, and to extend the triple alliance
by the inclusion of other powers; and, highly as he valued the
Prussian alliance, he would not consent that, merely to aggrandise
Prussia, England should lend herself to a policy which
would almost certainly have led to a new war. Accordingly,
the Duke of Leeds warned Frederick William that his plans
went beyond the treaty of alliance, which was purely defensive.
The death of the emperor Joseph, on February 20, 1790, changed
the situation, for his successor, Leopold II., was a practical and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
wary statesman. Frederick William was bent on war against
Russia and Austria, his minister signed a treaty with the Turks,
and he pressed England to acknowledge the independence of
the Austrian Netherlands. The English government took a decided
line, made him clearly understand that in the event of a
war he would be isolated, and proposed an immediate armistice.</p>

<p>Frederick William at last yielded to the representations of
England and Holland. Through the mediation of the allies an
armistice between Austria and the Turks was arranged on the
basis of the <i>status quo</i> at a congress at Reichenbach in July,
1790, and a formal peace was concluded the next year at
Sistova. The English government, anxious to prevent an
alliance between the revolted Netherlands and France, desired
the restoration of the Austrian power in the provinces, under
conditions which would shut out French influence by satisfying
the people; and accordingly the allies guaranteed the liberties of
the provinces, and they were regained by the emperor. The
ministry agreed with Prussia that support must be given to
Sweden, which was exhausted by its war with Russia; a subsidy
was promised and a squadron lay in the Downs ready to
sail for the Baltic. As soon as Catherine heard of the issue of
the conference at Reichenbach, she made a peace with Gustavus
without the mediation of the allies, which was concluded at
Werela in August. So far, then, in spite of serious difficulties
arising from the ambition of the Prussian king, the triple
alliance had enabled the government to carry out its policy
with success. Its formation secured the Dutch from the ascendency
of France; it strengthened the position of England
in its quarrel with Spain, saved the independence of Sweden,
mediated peace on the basis of the <i>status quo</i> between Austria
and the Porte, hindered the spread of French influence in the
Netherlands, and indirectly restored peace in the Baltic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RUSSIAN ARMAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_265" id="TOPIC_265"></a>Pitt's policy, however, received one decided check. Catherine
rejected the proposal of England that she should make peace
with the Turks on the basis of the <i>status quo</i> before the war,
and declared that she would keep Ochakov and the line of the
Dniester. Pitt differed from the views held by his father, the
whigs generally, and the coalition, with reference to Russia.
They looked on Russia as the natural ally of England, both
for commercial reasons and as a counterpoise to the Bourbon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
alliance, and Catherine owed much to England's good-will in
her war with the Turks in 1770 and during her conquest of
Crimea in 1783. Times had changed; and Pitt regarded with
displeasure the establishment of Russia on the Black Sea and
the prospect of the conquest of Constantinople, and held that
the Turks were useful as a check on Russian aggrandisement.
The possession of Ochakov was believed to be of the first importance
in the struggle between the two powers. Frederick
William urged that Catherine should be forced to resign it. In
1790 Pitt was opposing his wishes elsewhere; he was unwilling
to alienate him altogether, and agreed to put pressure on Russia.
The Turks were repeatedly defeated, and in December Suvorov
(Suwarrow) took Ismail; 12,000 Russians and 28,000 Turks
perishing in the storming and sack of the city, which are described
in Byron's splendid verse. In the following March, in
spite of some opposition, Pitt persuaded the cabinet to agree to
send a fleet to the Baltic, and a squadron to the Black Sea to
assist the Turks, while Frederick William invaded Livonia, and
on the 27th an ultimatum was despatched to St. Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The next day a royal message to parliament announced
the augmentation of the navy. Pitt sought to obtain a pledge
that parliament would support the government in its proposed
action. He met with strong opposition. Fox and others in
both houses maintained that our true policy was to be on good
terms with Russia, and that Russia had an undoubted right to
retain Ochakov. "The balance of Europe," it was urged, could
not be overset by its retention; it was a matter which did not
concern England; a war with Russia would be disastrous to
English trade and manufactures; if Russia became a power in
the Mediterranean so much the better, as its fleet would be a
check on the fleets of France and Spain. Burke vehemently
protested against England embarking on an "anti-crusade" by
assisting "destructive savages," as he called the Turks, against a
Christian power. Four times, in one form or another, the question
was debated in the commons. The government majorities
were large, though less than normal. In the cabinet Grenville
opposed the armament, and Pitt found that the feeling of the
country generally, and specially of the city of London and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
mercantile class, was strong on the same side. He yielded on
April 16; a messenger was sent in hot haste to St. Petersburg
to prevent the presentation of the ultimatum, and the Prussian
king was informed that the fleet would not sail to the Baltic.
Catherine was triumphant; she kept Ochakov and the line of
the Dniester, made terms with the Turks without the intervention
of other powers on August 11, 1791, and concluded a
definite peace at Jassy in the following January. Freed from
her wars with Sweden and the Porte, and from the danger of
foreign intervention in both cases, she was again able to pursue
her designs on Poland. She complimented Fox on the part he
had played, and placed his bust in her palace between those of
Demosthenes and Cicero. Pitt, who had lately refused the king's
offer of the garter, sarcastically referred in parliament to the compliments
his opponent received from a foreign sovereign.</p>

<p>Pitt's prestige was for a time seriously injured by this failure
and people talked of a possible change of government. Leeds
considered that as foreign secretary he was specially compromised,
and resigned the seals. As it was more difficult to
find a foreign than a home secretary, Pitt recommended that
Grenville should be transferred to the foreign department, that
Cornwallis should take Grenville's place, and that, until Cornwallis
returned from India, Dundas should have the seals, and
further suggested that Lord Hawkesbury (Jenkinson), then
president of the board of trade, should be called to the cabinet.
George agreed, but as Cornwallis declined the offer Dundas
remained home secretary. Pitt learnt that Ochakov was not
so important as he at first imagined; indeed the possession of
it by the Turks would not have rendered Constantinople safe
from attack nor protected Poland from further partition. His
failure, however, to carry out his scheme of coercing Russia was
a serious matter; it destroyed his hopes of an extension of the
defensive alliance, and the triple alliance itself, on which his
foreign policy had been built, virtually came to an end. Frederick
William was deeply annoyed and, in order to strengthen
his position with regard to Russia, made advances to Austria,
which led to an alliance between the two powers and to their
joint invasion of France.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_266" id="TOPIC_266"></a>The opinion of the great majority of the nation with regard
to the revolution in France was decided by the publication of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Burke's <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i> in November, 1790.
This famous work was primarily intended to rebut the assertions
of Price and others that the revolution in France was a more
perfect development of the ideas of the English revolution of
1688, that Englishmen had a right to choose their own governors,
cashier them for misconduct, and frame a government for themselves.
It describes the constitution as an inheritance to be
handed down to posterity uninjured and, if needs be, improved,
and exhibits and condemns the measures of the French assembly
as precipitate, unjust, and doomed to failure. Splendid alike as
a literary achievement and as a store-house of political wisdom,
it is also remarkable as a proof of Burke's prescience, for though
he wrote at an early stage of the revolution, before those savage
excesses which have made it a by-word, he foretold its future
course, not indeed without errors, but with wonderful sagacity.
Superbly national in sentiment, the book met the propaganda
of French ideas by appealing to the pride with which Englishmen
regarded their own institutions. Its success was immense.
Paine answered it in his <i>Rights of Man</i>, expressing revolutionary
ideas with a crude force which influenced thousands too
ignorant to detect its fallacies; and Mackintosh in his <i>Vindici&aelig;
Gallic&aelig;</i> expounded in polished sentences the position of the whig
sympathisers with the revolution. Neither undid the effect of
Burke's work. Of the well-to-do of all classes there was scarcely
one man in twenty who did not become an ardent anti-jacobin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RUPTURE BETWEEN BURKE AND FOX.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_267" id="TOPIC_267"></a>Stimulated by the success of the <i>Reflections</i>, Fox lost no
opportunity of declaring his admiration of the revolution in
parliament, and his followers irritated Burke by thwarting his
attempts to reply. At last the crisis came during a debate on
a bill for the government of Canada. After the settlement of
the United Empire Loyalists in western Canada, the demands
of the British colonists for the repeal of the Quebec act of 1774
became urgent. Pitt recognised the value of the French population
as a conservative force, a check on revolt, and in order to
do justice to both peoples, introduced a bill dividing the dominion
into two provinces, Upper and Lower Canada, each with its
own governor, elective assembly, and legislative council. Burke
supported this measure, which was passed, and is known as the
constitutional act of 1791. Fox objected to the principle of the
bill on the ground that the French and English inhabitants should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
coalesce, and to two special provisions in it, one that the sovereign
might grant hereditary titles with a right to sit in the council,
the other reserving certain crown lands for the support of the
protestant clergy. He blamed the proposal to revive titles of
honour in Canada when they had been abolished in France, and
jeered at Burke's lament in the <i>Reflections</i> on the extinction of
the spirit of chivalry among the French. A few days later, on
May 6, Burke, after much baiting by Fox's party, spoke strongly
of the danger of French propagandism, and declared that at the
risk of the desertion of friends he would exclaim with his latest
breath, "Fly from the French constitution!" "There is no
loss of friends," Fox whispered. "Yes," he said, "there is a
loss of friends. I have done my duty at the price of my friend;
our friendship is at an end." When Fox rose to reply the tears
trickled down his cheeks. The rupture was permanent. Burke
stood alone. His former friends treated him as a renegade, and
the whig newspapers showered abuse upon him. His answer
was a powerful vindication of the consistency of his position in
his <i>Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs</i>, which had a decided
effect on the opinions of many of Fox's party.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_268" id="TOPIC_268"></a>In June came the French king's flight to Varennes and his
enforced return to Paris. His queen Marie Antoinette appealed
to her brother the emperor for help. Leopold would do
nothing save in concert with the other great powers, and learnt
that England would take no part in a congress.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Pitt, always
more interested in domestic reforms than in foreign politics, had
no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of France.
War would hinder the commercial progress of the country; he
wanted fifteen years of peace to secure the full benefits of his
economic reforms: his policy was one of strict neutrality. He
shared in the general belief, so soon proved to be mistaken, that
the revolution would prevent France from engaging in war and
would ensure years of peace to England; the funds were high
and commerce was flourishing. Leopold could only look to
Prussia for co-operation. The attitude of England decided that
of Spain. Gustavus of Sweden was, indeed, eager for a war
of a crusading kind to re-establish the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, but this
idea was contrary to the policy of both Austria and Prussia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
and Gustavus allied himself with the French emigrant princes
who commanded an army at Coblentz; themselves selfish and
intriguing, their army undisciplined and ill-provided; Leopold
rated them at their proper value and was on his guard against
them. Frederick William, untrustworthy as he was, seems to
have been sincerely anxious to help the French king. Leopold
hoped to avoid war; he distrusted Prussia, and the designs of
Catherine on Poland caused both sovereigns to hesitate. In
August, however, the diet demanded that Leopold should
support certain princes of the German empire against France.
He held a conference with Frederick William at Pilnitz, and on
the 27th the two monarchs signed a declaration that they would
employ force on behalf of the French king, provided that the
powers to which they applied would join them. Leopold knew
that England would refuse, and the declaration was nugatory.
It enraged the French, and was used by the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> as though
it promised the fulfilment of their hopes for an invasion of
France by a foreign confederation. Calonne, who acted as
their minister, applied to Pitt for an assurance of neutrality and
for a loan. Pitt refused his requests and would not recognise
him as having any formal authority. On September 13 Louis
was forced to accept the new French constitution, and Leopold
declared that his acceptance put an end to all need for intervention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_269" id="TOPIC_269"></a>The French were not content to leave other peoples alone.
To the more ardent revolutionists the revolution was not a
mere political event in the history of their country; it was a
religion which it was the mission of France to propagate. No
part of France was to remain outside it; the feudal rights of
princes of the empire in Alsace and Lorraine were abolished,
and Avignon and the Venaissin were declared French territory.
No people wishing to share in its benefits was to be left
unenlightened, and French democrats were already intriguing
with the factions in the Netherlands which were opposed to the
Austrian rule. In England the propaganda had as yet made
little way, though the democrats were noisy. At Birmingham,
where Priestley had his chapel, they arranged to hold a dinner
on July 14 to celebrate the fall of the Bastille, and a seditious
address was circulated. In the evening of that day a violent
riot broke out. The mob, with shouts of "Church and king,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
wrecked two dissenting chapels and seven houses belonging to
prominent democrats, one of them Priestley's house, where they
destroyed his library, philosophical apparatus, and papers. The
riot lasted for two days and was finally quelled by dragoons.
Three of the rioters were hanged, and over &pound;26,000 was paid
by the neighbouring hundreds as compensation to the sufferers.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_270" id="TOPIC_270"></a>Though both as a king and as a German prince George was
indignant at the proceedings of the French revolutionists, he
fully acquiesced in Pitt's determined neutrality. How little at
the beginning of the session of 1792 Pitt expected to be driven
from his position is shown by the line which he adopted in
parliament. The king's speech declared that the state of Europe
seemed to promise that the country would continue to enjoy
tranquillity. The naval force was reduced to 16,000 men, and
the proposed reductions in the two services amounted to
&pound;200,000. For the last four years there had been an average
yearly surplus of &pound;400,000, and Pitt proposed to add &pound;200,000
a year to the sinking fund and to remit taxes to the same
amount. He also instituted an additional system for the reduction
of debt by providing that every new loan should carry
a sinking fund of its own. When this scheme was before the
lords, Thurlow poured ridicule upon it, and spoke of its author
with contempt. The king wrote to Pitt, hoping that his old
friend would own himself in the wrong, and that Pitt would
overlook the offence. Pitt, who had borne long enough with
Thurlow's sullen temper and constant opposition, told the king
plainly that he must choose between him and the chancellor.
George did not hesitate, and Thurlow, much to his surprise, received
an order to give up the great seal. He retired at the
end of the session, on June 15, and the great seal was put in
commission. Pitt's ascendency in the cabinet was placed beyond
dispute. The dismissal of Thurlow marks a step in the progress
of the development of the cabinet system. It was no longer
possible, as in the earlier years of the reign, for a minister to
remain in office, through the king's favour, against the will of
the prime minister. When a prime minister is dissatisfied with
one of his colleagues he can insist on his resignation, for if he
requests his dismissal, his request cannot be rejected unless the
sovereign is prepared to take new advisers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A WHIG SCHEME OF COALITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_271" id="TOPIC_271"></a>The loss of the chancellor was erroneously believed to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
weakened the government. Some of the whig party, of which
the Duke of Portland was the recognised head, busied themselves
in devising a coalition government. Apart from the
sweets of office, the condition of their party rendered the idea
specially attractive to them. Burke's appeal to the whigs to
maintain their old principles, which he urged in person at a
meeting of the heads of the party on June 9, 1792, convinced
them that unless Fox moderated "his tone and temper," it
might become impossible for them to continue to work with
him. A junction with the government might save them from
disruption. It was proposed that Pitt should resign the treasury,
that he and Fox should be joint secretaries of state and that the
treasury should be held by the Duke of Leeds, as a neutral,
who would be little more than a figure-head. This precious
scheme, chiefly, at least, set on foot by Loughborough in the
hope of gaining the chancellorship, was debated among them
for weeks. Loughborough, who was not a man to be trusted,
led them to believe that some of Pitt's confidential friends were
in favour of it, and had assured him that Pitt would readily
agree to it. Fox approved of the idea of coalition if he was to
have an equal share with Pitt of power and patronage. Leeds
mentioned the idea of a coalition to the king, who received it
coldly, for George hated Fox; he did not intend to alter his
government to suit the whig leaders, and he knew that they
were mistaken as regards Pitt's attitude. At last Leeds spoke
of the scheme to Pitt who drily told him that circumstances did
not call for any alteration in the government and that no new
arrangement had ever been in contemplation.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> If the Portland
whigs were to separate themselves from Fox and his friends
and were to support the government, they would have to support
the government of Pitt, and that after a while, as we shall
see, they resolved to do.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_272" id="TOPIC_272"></a>Early in 1792 war between France and Austria and Prussia
seemed at hand. The French ministers hoped to obtain an
alliance with England, or at the least an assurance of neutrality
in case of an invasion of the Netherlands, and to arrange a loan.
They were prepared to offer Tobago and even Mauritius to boot.
Talleyrand, the ex-Bishop of Autun, came over in an unofficial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
capacity to see how matters stood and to intrigue with the
opposition. At court the king treated him coldly and the queen
turned her back on him. He had interviews with Pitt and
Grenville, and got nothing out of them; he received much
attention from the opposition and returned to France in March.
Meanwhile, on February 7, Leopold, unable to disregard the
call of the diet and uneasy about the Netherlands, agreed with
Frederick William to restore order in France, both allies intending
to be indemnified. Yet war did not come at once, and on
March 1 Leopold died. His son and successor, Francis II., was
less distrustful of Prussia, and was eager for war. Under the
influence of a party, somewhat later known as the Girondists,
the French assembly was brought to desire war with Austria.
On the accession of this party to power Dumouriez became
minister of foreign affairs. He designed to detach Prussia
from the Austrian alliance, isolate Austria, invade the Austrian
Netherlands, where the people seemed ready for revolt, and
establish them as an independent republic, and prosecute further
plans for the extension of France to its "natural barriers".
Gustavus was assassinated, and Sweden adopted a neutral
policy; Russia, though violently hostile, was engaged in Poland,
England decided the policy of Spain and would be followed by
Holland. Would England oppose an invasion of the Netherlands
on the understanding that France would not conquer them
for herself; could the government be persuaded to an alliance
by offers of Tobago, a mutual guarantee of possessions, and a
treaty of commerce; and could a loan be arranged? Negotiation
on these points was entrusted to Talleyrand who was to
accompany Chauvelin, the accredited ambassador, to England.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
On April 20 France declared war on the "King of Hungary
and Bohemia," as Francis was entitled before his election.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SEDITIOUS PUBLICATIONS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_273" id="TOPIC_273"></a>While England's official relations with France remained
friendly, dislike of the revolution was growing stronger, and
the more moderate whigs were changing their opinions with
regard to it. This change was largely due to the active propagation
of revolutionary ideas among the lower classes, which
was carried on by various societies. The Friends of the People,
a respectable association of the more extreme whigs, excluding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Fox, who would not join it, was formed in the spring of 1792
to promote parliamentary reform; some of its proceedings were
discreditable, but it kept clear of connexion with the French
revolutionists. Not so the Revolution Society, the Society for
Constitutional Information, and the London Correspondence
Society, which were in correspondence with the jacobins of
Paris. The last, the most formidable of them, was directed by
a secret council, and had branches in various large towns, the
Sheffield branch alone numbering 2,400 members. Meetings
were held in which the most violent revolutionary sentiments
were loudly applauded, and seditious handbills and pamphlets,
chief among them the second part of Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i>,
were distributed by tens of thousands. Though the number
of persons who adopted revolutionary ideas was as yet comparatively
small, the propaganda was carried on noisily, and
was certainly gaining ground. The government saw that it
was time to interfere, and, on May 21, issued a royal proclamation
against seditious writings. The address to the crown in
answer to the proclamation was opposed in the commons by
Grey. Fox supported him, and declared that the proclamation
was merely a move taken by the government to divide the
"whig interest," which, he said, nothing could divide. Nevertheless
Windham and others of Fox's party supported the
government, and the address was carried without a division.
Proceedings were taken against Paine by the attorney-general;
he fled to France and became a member of the convention. For
a time the propaganda was checked.</p>

<p>The feeling which it excited strengthened the government.
Acting in connexion with the Society of the Friends of the
People, Grey gave notice of a motion for a reform of parliament.
Pitt said that it was "not a time to make hazardous
experiments"; and though Fox, Erskine, and Sheridan spoke
on the other side, he was supported by the larger number of
the party. Pitt was delighted at this split, and hoped to obtain
a pledge of co-operation against the propaganda from "the most
respectable members of opposition".<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Matters were not ripe
for this. An attempt of Fox to procure the relief of the unitarians
from penal laws was defeated by a large majority,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
owing to the active part which they were taking in spreading
principles subversive, so Pitt said, "of every established religion
and every established government". Chauvelin and Talleyrand
found themselves avoided by society generally. They held constant
communication with Fox, Sheridan, Lord Lansdowne,
and other enemies of the government; and Chauvelin had the
impertinence to send a remonstrance to Grenville against the
proclamation of May 21, for which he was duly rebuked. All
that they could obtain from Grenville was an assurance that
England desired to remain at peace with France, and hoped
that France would respect the rights of the king and his allies;
if, in other words, the French wished England to remain neutral,
they must keep their hands off Holland. No better success
attended the effort to detach Prussia from the Austrian alliance,
and the Prussian king declared himself at war with France.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_274" id="TOPIC_274"></a>An attempt of the French to snatch the Austrian Netherlands
ended miserably; their soldiers fled before the emperor's
army of occupation on April 29, mutinied, and murdered one of
their generals. The allied armies under the Duke of Brunswick
were gathering, and Paris was in a ferment. Neither of the two
national assemblies, not the first, called the constituent, nor its
successor, the legislative assembly, could govern. The Paris
mob, bestial and sanguinary, was supreme, and was moved from
time to time to violent action by individuals or groups which
played upon and pandered to its passions. On June 20 a
carefully engineered insurrection exposed the king and queen
to cruel insults and imminent danger. The long agony of the
monarchy was drawing to a close. After protracted delays the
allies began to move, and, on July 25, Brunswick published an
ill-judged manifesto which excited the French to fury. The
British ambassador, Lord Gower, wrote that the lives of the
king and queen were threatened, and asked if he might represent
the sentiments of his court. Determined not to give
any cause of offence, the government refused to allow him to
speak officially. On August 10 another prearranged insurrection
was raised in Paris; the king and queen sought refuge with
the assembly, and the king's Swiss guards and officers were
massacred. He and the queen were imprisoned, and royalty
was "suspended". Gower was at once recalled. This was
not a hostile act; the king to whom he was accredited no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
longer reigned, and to have accredited him to the provisional
government, which had deposed the king, would have been
indecent and a just cause of offence to the allied powers.
Before leaving he was instructed to express his master's determination
to remain neutral, and his earnest hope that the
king and queen would be safe from any violence, "which
could not fail to produce one universal sentiment of indignation
throughout every country of Europe". Talleyrand left
England; Chauvelin remained, though the king's deposition
deprived him of his character as ambassador.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRENCH CONQUESTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_275" id="TOPIC_275"></a>The allied armies entered France; Longwy surrendered on
the 26th and Verdun on the 31st. A few days later England
was horrified by the news of the massacres of September; the
indignation was general, and Fox spoke of the massacres with
genuine disgust. The success of the allies was short-lived;
Dumouriez defeated the Prussians at Valmy on September
20, and before the end of October the invaders were forced
to evacuate France. A French army seized Savoy and Nice,
which were annexed to France, and another overran the principalities
on the left bank of the Rhine, receiving the surrenders
of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz, crossed the river and took Frankfort.
Meanwhile Dumouriez entered the Austrian Netherlands;
he defeated the Austrians at Jemappes, and the Netherlands
were lost to the emperor. Everywhere the French posed as
liberators and set up republican institutions. While France
was allured by the Girondist idea of universal emancipation,
it carried on the traditions of the old monarchy in its aggressions;
it was so in the Rhineland and the Netherlands, and it
was so with regard to the Dutch republic. French republicanism
was industriously propagated in the provinces, and the "patriot"
party, which was defeated in 1787, was again encouraged to
revolt. Determined not to be drawn into war, the British
government, in July, warned the states-general not to be persuaded
to join the allies, and the Dutch remained neutral. In
November, a victorious French army was on their border, and
a strong party among them was ready to co-operate with it by
overthrowing the stadholder as soon as it entered their territory.
England was bound alike by honour and her own interest to
defend the stadholder, and the French knew that, if they desired
that England should remain neutral, they must not molest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Holland. On the 13th the states-general applied to England
for an assurance of help if need arose. It was, Pitt felt,
"absolutely impossible to hesitate," and Grenville assured the
states-general that England would faithfully fulfil the stipulations
of the treaty of 1788.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRENCH PROVOCATIONS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_276" id="TOPIC_276"></a>Holland was in imminent danger, and in the hope that some
combined action might lead to a general pacification, the English
government sought to open confidential communications with
Austria and Prussia. The replies of the two powers were delayed;
they were arranging for their respective indemnifications;
for their plans were upset by the failure of their invasion
of France. Catherine had invaded Poland in the spring, and
Frederick William, who had more than once guaranteed the
integrity of the kingdom, betrayed the Poles, and agreed with
the empress to make a second partition of Poland between
themselves. That was to be his indemnity; the emperor was
to be gratified by being allowed to exchange the Netherlands
for Bavaria. Great Britain protested, but in vain. The second
partition of Poland was carried out in 1793. Scarcely had
Grenville assured the Dutch that England would stand by
them, when, on the 16th, the French executive declared the
Scheldt open, and soon afterwards sent ships of war by it to
Antwerp. This decree violated the rights of the Dutch, which
had been confirmed by the treaty of Fontainebleau in 1785, and
which England was bound to defend by the treaty of 1788.
It showed that France assumed the right of subverting the
political system of Europe by setting treaties at nought, and
it was a direct defiance of England.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only provocation which England received.
The downfall of the French monarchy excited the revolutionary
societies to fresh activity, and the propaganda was carried on
with amazing insolence. Deputations from these societies appeared
before the national convention with congratulatory addresses
and were received with effusion. The constitutional
society, for example, hoped that Frenchmen would soon have
to congratulate an English national convention, and the president
in reply expressed his belief that France would soon hail
England as a sister-republic. Emissaries from the French
ministry promoted sedition both in England and in Ireland,
and their reports led their employers to believe that England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Scotland, and Ireland were ripe for revolt.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> It was an absurd
mistake. Yet though the number of revolutionists was still
comparatively small, the propaganda caused much uneasiness.
Thousands of French refugees were landing in England, mostly
priests and members of the aristocracy, many of them completely
destitute. Subscriptions were raised for their relief,
and Burke and others exerted themselves nobly in their behalf.
This large immigration made it easy for French spies and
revolutionary agents to carry on their work undetected. Its
progress was helped forward by discontent among the lower
class. The harvest was bad and the price of wheat rose, trade
was depressed, and there was much distress, specially in the
manufacturing districts. Riots broke out at Carlisle, Leeds,
Yarmouth, Shields, Leith, Perth, and Dundee, and in some cases
were connected with revolutionary sentiments. At Dundee
cries were raised of "No excise, no king," and a tree of liberty
was planted. On November 19 the convention openly asserted
its right to overthrow the government of other countries by
decreeing that France would help, and would instruct her
generals to help, all peoples that desired freedom; and an
order was given that translations of this decree should be
distributed in all countries. The decree was an invitation to
the subjects of every state in Europe to revolt, and the propaganda
which it authorised was a gross insult to the British
government and nation.</p>

<p>The danger of Holland and the activity of revolutionists at
home convinced the ministry that it was time to take measures
of defence. On December 1 a part of the militia was embodied,
and parliament was summoned for the 13th; the Tower was fortified,
naval preparations were set on foot, a squadron was ordered
to the mouth of the Scheldt, and an order of council prohibited
the exportation of grain to France. Grenville informed the
Dutch that England was arming, and called on them to arm
also. Pitt still hoped for peace, and suggested to a French
envoy that his government should give him assurances through
an authorised agent with respect to the safety of Holland and
the decree of November 19. The executive council would only
treat through Chauvelin, who was offensive.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> On the 27th he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
demanded whether England was to be reckoned neutral or an
enemy of France; he protested that the decree did not apply
to England, and that no attack would be made on Holland, but
said that France would not give way as to the Scheldt, and
threatened that if the ministers decided on war, they would find
the nation against them. Already a decree of the convention
passed on the 15th had ordained that all states occupied by
French armies should virtually be subject to France, and should
contribute to the support of the French troops. The war of
"liberation" had become a war of conquest.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Grenville replied
to Chauvelin on the 31st to the effect that the protestations of
the executive council were belied by its conduct, that England
could not consent that France should annul treaties at her
pleasure, or be indifferent to her assumption of sovereignty
over the Netherlands, and that if she desired England's friendship,
she should abandon her views of aggression and cease
to insult or disturb other governments.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISRUPTION OF THE WHIG PARTY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_277" id="TOPIC_277"></a>During the first days of the session Pitt was absent; he had
at the king's earnest wish accepted the valuable sinecure office
of warden of the Cinque Ports, and was not yet re-elected. In
moving an amendment to the address on the 14th Fox made a
violent attack on the government. At that critical time when
England's welfare demanded that party enmities should yield
before the importance of union against sedition at home and
aggression abroad, he did not scruple to declare that the government
had wilfully exaggerated domestic disturbances, in order
to establish a system of oppression more intolerable than "the
horrors of the inquisition of Spain," and implied that the
ministers were hostile to France merely because France was, as
he jeeringly said, "an unanointed republic". Windham and
other whigs voted against him, and his amendment was rejected
by 290 to 50. He returned to the charge, but spoke more
moderately, on the next day and again on the next, with a
motion for sending an ambassador to Paris, which was negatived
without a division. The disruption of the whig party
was obvious; Portland, Fitzwilliam, Spencer, Carlisle, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Loughborough in the lords, and in the commons Windham,
Elliot, and many more voted with the government, and Burke
took his seat on the treasury bench. Loughborough received
the great seal on January 28, 1793, but the rest as yet gave
the ministers independent support. An addition of 9,000 men
to the naval force and increased army estimates were voted
unanimously, Fox declaring his approval on the ground that
the position of foreign affairs demanded them. An alien bill
was also carried, subjecting foreign immigrants to police regulations
and empowering the secretary of state to expel them.
This bill was opposed in the lords by Lansdowne, and in the
commons by Fox and Grey. In the course of an almost
frenzied speech in support of it, Burke threw a dagger on the
floor of the house, a specimen, he said, of three thousand which,
he was informed on excellent authority, had been ordered in
Birmingham by an English revolutionist.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_278" id="TOPIC_278"></a>Chauvelin, whose credentials as "minister plenipotentiary of
the French republic" were not accepted by the English court
protested against the alien bill and the prohibition of the export
of grain, and declared that France considered the treaty of
commerce of 1786 broken and annulled. The two measures
excited the indignation of the convention; the speedy downfall
of England was triumphantly predicted; 3,000,000 Irishmen
were ready to revolt, and India would shake off the British rule
as soon as the French appeared in Asia. The executive council
was pressed to demand the repeal of both measures, and a satisfactory
explanation of the English military preparations, and
orders were given for the immediate armament of a fleet. While
the French ministers were already preparing for a descent on
England,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and France was reducing the Austrian Netherlands
to a merely municipal status, the contemplated invasion of
Holland was delayed by the condition of the French army;
and negotiations with England were carried on. Believing
that if the English people were assured with respect to the
Netherlands and the intention of France not to interfere in
their domestic concerns, they would declare against the government
in case of a war, the French foreign minister protested
that the occupation of the Netherlands was merely temporary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
that France looked forward to Belgian independence, and that
the decree of November 19 only applied to a case where the
general will of the people was expressed. The opening of the
Scheldt was defended as authorised by the law of nature. This
paper, which was a kind of ultimatum, did not withdraw the
claim to propagate republicanism in other states or to annul
the treaty rights of England's allies, and put no definite limit
to the occupation of the Austrian Netherlands. Grenville returned
a haughty answer. War was almost certain. The
execution of the French king on the 21st hastened the end.
The tidings were received in London with universal grief and
indignation; the theatres were closed, and not the court alone,
but all who could afford it, wore mourning. As the king drove
through the streets, cries were raised of "War with France!"
Chauvelin was ordered to quit the kingdom in eight days, and
left at once. <a name="TOPIC_279" id="TOPIC_279"></a>On February 1 France declared war on England
and Holland. In common with the nation at large, George
welcomed the declaration of war; the "insolence" of France
irritated him, and the execution of the French king was an
insult and a menace to every crowned head in Europe; yet
the order of the king in council for Chauvelin's departure was
of course given on the advice of the ministers.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAR WITH FRANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_280" id="TOPIC_280"></a>Pitt had striven long and earnestly to avoid war. It was
finally forced upon him. Grossly as the government was provoked
by French attempts to spread republicanism in the king's
dominions, that alone would not have forced him into war; the
great mass of the English people was thoroughly loyal, and the
resources of government were sufficient to deal with sedition.
But England was bound in honour to defend the rights of the
Dutch, and her own security demanded that she should withstand
the French designs of aggrandisement. Burke would
have had war declared on France as an enemy of God and
mankind, because she trampled on institutions which he regarded
as sacred in themselves and essential to the well-being
of society. The feelings of the nation were excited by the
excesses of the revolution, until the crowning act of the king's
execution called forth a demand for war; and as the war went
on hatred of French principles made Englishmen willing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
bear the heavy burdens it entailed. But in the great decision
Pitt was unmoved by sentiments such as these. Unlike the
rulers of Austria and Prussia, the government was not embarking
on a war either of principles or ambition, not on a crusade
against republicanism nor, in its inception, a struggle for extended
dominions; its object was to maintain the honour and
the security of England. The opening of the Scheldt by
France was a far more serious matter for England than if
Leopold II. had succeeded in his attempt to carry out the same
measure; for France was a great maritime power and entertained
schemes of boundless ambition. That she contemplated
the annexation of the Austrian Netherlands and the conquest
of Holland was certain, and if she became mistress of the
Netherlands and Holland, and had Antwerp as a station for
her fleet, the security of England would be at an end.</p>

<p>Security could only be attained either by war or by an
alliance with the republic, which would have been repugnant
to the nation, would have made England partner in unjustifiable
aggressions, and would have betrayed the interests of
Europe to France. While it may be urged that the haughty
tone adopted by Grenville during the last few weeks of peace
irritated France, and that the dismissal of Chauvelin put an end
to further attempts at reconciliation, it will scarcely be denied
that the government was justified in refusing to prolong useless
communications, and that it acted wisely in taking a decided
step when the country was thoroughly prepared to support its
decision. Having to choose between war and all that an alliance
with France would have entailed, England chose war, and
took her stand in the breach which France made in the political
system, true to herself and finally the saviour of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_281" id="TOPIC_281"></a>The violent opposition of Fox seems to have proceeded from
mixed causes. That he sincerely loved liberty must be allowed,
but he was less attracted by the constitutional liberty of Burke's
devotion, which like some stately building grows towards completeness
as each successive generation enters into and carries
on the labours of its predecessors, than by the cause of liberty,
whether truly or falsely so called, in revolt. Unbridled in his
own life, he loved resistance to authority. And he was one of
those, in England unfortunately there are always such, who
rate the cause they love above their country's cause. It was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
with him during the American war. When he would describe
how much an event pleased him he wrote, "no public event,
not excepting Saratoga and Yorktown, ever gave me so much
delight". It was so during the war with France. His opposition,
however, also proceeded from hatred to the government.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
Abhorred by the king and rejected by the country, he resented
his exclusion from office by opposing the government at a time
when Englishmen should have sunk all party differences in the
face of their country's peril. He ascribed the measures taken to
repress sedition and defeat the French propaganda as attempts
at tyranny. While he acknowledged that the opening of the
Scheldt was a <i>casus belli</i>, he spoke of it as a matter which
England could well afford to overlook, and he represented the
action of the government as unfair to France and as the result
of monarchical prejudice. As the war went on his unpatriotic
feelings were constantly displayed in a most offensive manner.
His conduct broke up the whig party. England was entering
on a period of fearful conflict; happy at least in that the confidence
of the nation was given to a statesman whose one
absorbing care was for the welfare of his country.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>THE FIRST COALITION.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_282" id="TOPIC_282"></a>The nine years between Pitt's accession to office and the outbreak
of the war with France were a period of advance in constitutional
freedom and financial prosperity. All progress in these
directions was arrested by the war. The security of England, a
matter of higher importance than these, was at stake. The war
demanded all the energies of the nation. Questions which would
have divided the country or weakened the government were
shelved, for it was not a time to debate reforms when the state
itself was in peril. Pitt defeated efforts for parliamentary reform
and grew cold to the cause of the abolition of the slave trade.
But the war brought worse than an arrest of progress;
it brought repression of freedom and a tremendous load of debt.
The French propaganda roused general indignation and alarm.
Towards the end of 1792 the ministers were convinced of the
existence of a plot for effecting a revolution by the aid of France.
There was much to justify their alarm; Ireland seemed ripe for
revolt, political discontent was strong in Scotland, and evidence,
gained later, confirmed them in their belief that sedition was
reaching a dangerous height in England. They overrated the
existing danger, though if sedition had remained unchecked it
might soon have become dangerous; for France was attacking
the state by secret seduction as well as by open arms. Extraordinary
precautions were taken to meet a peril which was
specially terrible because its extent was unknown. Measures
of repression were eagerly welcomed by parliament; judges and
magistrates exercised their powers with harshness, and juries
were often biassed by the feeling of the bench. The nation was
alarmed, and severity was popular.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT AS A WAR MINISTER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_283" id="TOPIC_283"></a>Pitt, who had guided England in peace, was to remain at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
helm in war. The conduct of the war is therefore closely connected
with the question whether, great as he was in peace, he
was a great war minister.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The British army, which in 1792
only numbered about 17,300 men and at the outbreak of the
war was increased by 9,945, was so small that it could only
either act a secondary part in a continental war, or engage in
isolated expeditions to support insurrections in France. During
the first part of the war our successes on land were trifling and
our failures many. This was partly at least due to the custom
of regarding noble birth rather than military attainments as a
claim to command. Though Pitt, as we shall see, insisted on
the recall of the Duke of York, he did not break through this
evil custom, and our generals, though brave, were often incompetent.
Pitt built great hopes on the co-operation of the French
royalists and many expeditions were sent out to act with them.
A belligerent power should place little dependence on insurrectionary
movements in an enemy's country; for insurgents, however
hostile they may be to their own government, will seldom
act cordially with a foreign invader; their forces are generally
unorganised, and they are apt to expect too much of their foreign
ally. It is good policy to encourage them by sending them supplies,
for their revolts embarrass their government and are useful
as diversions in war. But a belligerent should not squander
on diversions strength which might be employed in the main
conflict. Pitt's expeditions of this kind were costly failures;
they inflicted no deadly wound and were expensive both in men
and money. On the other hand England was victorious by sea;
the naval force was raised to 45,000 men in February, 1793, was
constantly increased, and was commanded by admirals whose
right to command was based on their skill in seamanship and
maritime warfare.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_284" id="TOPIC_284"></a>For the security of England and the peace of Europe
France, it was held, must be reduced to powerlessness. England's
greatness at sea might enable her to destroy the enemy's
commerce, conquer her colonies, and blockade her ports; the
object of the war could be attained only by victories on land.
Politically the continental states were rotten; their rulers were
selfish despots, each bent on extending his dominions by any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
means, however dishonest; for international morality had broken
down before the bait offered by the weakness of Poland. What
barrier could they oppose to the flood of French aggression, the
outcome of the enthusiasm of a great people? When France
forced England into war she provoked a more dangerous enemy&mdash;the
will of a nation. Supported by the national will, Pitt embarked
on the task of combining the powers of Europe against
France, and as some were unwilling and some unable to fight
at their own expense, he paid them with English gold, and
England found money for them as well as for her own naval
and military operations. Pitt raised enormous loans. The
funded debt, which in 1792 was, roughly, &pound;238,000,000, rose
during nine years of war to about &pound;574,000,000. He began to
borrow at once; in 1793 he raised a loan of &pound;4,500,000, and
in 1794 another of &pound;11,000,000, besides imposing new taxes
amounting to &pound;913,000.</p>

<p>He has been blamed for not raising more by taxation during
the early years of the war instead of burdening posterity so
heavily. The financial difficulties of France led him to believe
that the war would be short. "It will be a short war," he said,
"and certainly ended in one or two campaigns." "No, sir,"
replied the more prescient Burke, "it will be a long war and a
dangerous war; but it must be undertaken." In its earliest
years Pitt had good reason for avoiding high taxation. It
began in the midst of a financial crisis. The harvest of 1792
was seriously defective, and there was much want. The rapid
advance in agriculture, commerce, and manufactures had led to
the foundation of many country banks, which eagerly pushed
their own notes into circulation, and credit was unduly strained.
Currency became redundant, and a violent revulsion began in
November, 1792, when the number of bankruptcies in the month
amounted to 105, more than double the average number of the
ten earlier months of the year. The crisis became more acute
in the spring of 1793, and during the year there were 1,926
failures, of which twenty-six were failures of country banks.
In order to relieve the distress Pitt, in April, obtained the assent
of parliament for the issue of exchequer bills to the extent
of &pound;5,000,000 to be applied in advances at fair interest and
on good security. Fox offered a factious opposition to this
measure, alleging that it conferred a dangerous power on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
executive. It was completely successful, and the panic was
checked. As, then, Pitt believed that the war would be short,
and as it was not a time for attempting to raise taxation to
an amount sufficient to furnish the supplies within the year, he
was justified in having an early recourse to loans.</p>

<p>In return for the &pound;336,000,000 of debt created by Pitt in
nine years, the country only received about &pound;223,000,000 in
money; and he has been accused of extravagance because he
raised money mainly in 3 per cent. stock instead of at a rate
more nearly corresponding to its market value. In 1793 every
&pound;100 borrowed created &pound;138 stock, and when in 1797 the
3 per cents. fell to 47, the sacrifice was enormous. Pitt did
attempt to raise a loan at a higher rate in 1793, and found it
impossible; and it is at least doubtful whether he did not act
more prudently in borrowing in the 3 per cents. than at a high
rate.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> In his budget speech of 1793 he announced that he
would always maintain the sinking fund. He kept his promise,
and this expensive economy provided a deduction of
&pound;42,500,000 from the &pound;336,000,000 of debt. Financially, as
we have seen, this was a mistake; politically it was useful in
encouraging and comforting the country in a time of stress;
for the opposition was as fully persuaded as the ministry of the
efficacy of the fund. If, then, it be allowed that the war was
just and necessary, little fault should be found with the way in
which money was provided for it. That Pitt's subsidies were
sometimes unwise may be conceded; that his coalitions disappointed
him is certain. He had to contend with selfishness
and deceit in the rulers of Europe, and laboured with ability
and courage to keep them steadfast to the common cause, again
and again taking up his task, undismayed by failures which are
not to be laid to his charge. While mistakes in the conduct
of the war forbid us to call him a great war minister in the
narrow sense of the term, we should scarcely refuse that praise
in a wider, truer sense to a minister so dauntless in adversity,
so fertile in resource, so deservedly trusted by the nation as
"the pilot that weathered the storm".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COALITION FORMED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_285" id="TOPIC_285"></a>In March the government hired troops from Hanover and
Hesse Cassel; and during the year, Holland being already an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
ally, made treaties hostile to France with all the other Christian
powers of Europe except Denmark, Sweden, the Swiss, Tuscany
Venice, and Genoa, which decided on neutrality. The emperor
and the Prussian king agreed to carry on the war in concert with
England. Catherine of Russia made a treaty of commerce, and
another promising co-operation against the commerce of France.
Her army was engaged in Poland, and she took no part in the
war beyond carrying out her engagement by means of her fleet.
In May, the convention declared war on Spain and the king
entered into the coalition. The King of Sardinia was already
at war, and the British government granted him a subsidy of
&pound;200,000 to enable him to keep up his army, and agreed to
send a fleet into the Mediterranean. A treaty for concerted
action in the Mediterranean was made with the king of the
Two Sicilies, and another treaty with Portugal, our ancient ally,
which became of importance after Spain deserted the coalition.
The accession of England to the enemies of France gave them
a new weapon against her. Great Britain and Russia agreed
to prevent neutral ships from supplying her with provisions,
and, on June 8, British officers were ordered to stop all ships
so engaged and send them to England, where their cargoes
would be sold and their freights paid by the government.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_286" id="TOPIC_286"></a>The emperor did not relish the idea of a disinterested war;
and Grenville agreed that the allies should indemnify themselves,
and should make conquests on the Belgian frontier of France,
which in Austrian hands would form a strong barrier against
her. This met the emperor's views, for an enlargement of the
Austrian Netherlands would forward his plan of exchanging
them for Bavaria. The proposed exchange, however, was
contrary to English policy, for it would have created a weak
state on the French frontier. As soon as war was declared,
Dumouriez invaded Holland, but was soon called back to
Belgium, where the French were losing ground. He was defeated
at Neerwinden on March 18, and the French withdrew
from the Netherlands. They were unsuccessful on the Rhine,
and Mainz was threatened by the Prussians. Dissatisfied with
the proceedings of his government, Dumouriez intrigued with
the enemy and finally fled to the Austrian camp, but was unable
to carry his army with him. On April 8 a conference
between representatives of the allies was held at Antwerp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Lord Auckland, the British minister in Holland, appeared for
England, accompanied by the king's second son, the Duke of
York, who was to command the British and Hanoverian army.
The allies agreed to make conquests and keep them. Auckland
declared that this was the policy of his court. Austria
was to gain places on the frontier which would shut France out
from the Netherlands, England would look to the conquest of
Dunkirk and the French colonies.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_287" id="TOPIC_287"></a>On May 20 the British army with its Hanoverian and
Hessian contingents joined the Prince of Coburg, and took a
distinguished part in driving the French from their camp at
Famars. The smart appearance of the English troops was much
admired, but their officers were careless. The French army of
the north was disorderly and discouraged. While the regular
troops generally behaved well, the volunteers, who had a separate
organisation and elected their own officers, were insubordinate
and lacking in soldierly qualities; the representatives of the
people who accompanied the army, though they did some good,
meddled in military matters; the generals were suspected, were
constantly displaced, and were fortunate if they escaped the
scaffold; and the ministry of war was utterly incompetent. The
allies besieged Cond&eacute; and Valenciennes; Cond&eacute; surrendered on
July 13 and Valenciennes on the 28th, and the Austrians took
possession of both. Coburg's allies were anxious to secure territory
for themselves, and he had some difficulty in persuading
them to join him in an attack on the French at C&aelig;sar's
camp, a strong position covered by the Scheldt, the Sens&eacute;e, and
the Agache. The French were driven out and fell back on
Arras. France was in sore straits. Mainz capitulated on July
23, and the army of the Moselle retreated behind the Saar. On
the Spanish frontier Roussillon was invaded. In the Alps the
republican army was driven back near Saorgio, and its best troops
were sent off to quell insurrection in the cities of the south;
for the country was torn by civil discord. The Girondins were
overthrown in June, and the party called the Mountain gained
absolute power. Bordeaux was a centre of resistance; Marseilles,
Lyons, and Toulon were in revolt, and were supported by
the towns of the Jura and Provence. An insurrection which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
began in the Vendean district of Anjou grew to a formidable
height. The army of La Vend&eacute;e, of 40,000 men, defeated the
republican generals, captured Saumur, and threatened Nantes.
Between Basle and the sea the allies were 280,000 strong; an
advance on Paris in two directions, from the Belgian border by
Soissons and from Mainz by Reims, would almost certainly have
ended the war. After the capture of C&aelig;sar's camp the way to
Paris lay open to Coburg; there was no French force strong
enough to arrest the march of the allies.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISCORDANT AIMS OF THE ALLIES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_288" id="TOPIC_288"></a>The coalition was paralysed by discord and by the insistence
of its members on the pursuit of different objects. The English
ministers made the security of the Netherlands as an Austrian
province a prime consideration, and to satisfy them the emperor
promised to give up the exchange of the Netherlands for
Bavaria. He was to be indemnified by the acquisition of Alsace
and Lorraine, which were to be conquered by the help of Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
Frederick William, however, would not help to conquer territory
for Austria, nor assist in the dismemberment of France, unless
the emperor assented to the treaty for the partition of Poland
secretly arranged between him and Catherine of Russia, and
signed on January 23. Baron Thugut, the Austrian minister,
who was violently hostile toward Prussia, would not assent to a
treaty which aggrandised that power and did not give his master
a share in the spoil. While, then, France, distressed by invasion,
revolt, and scarcity, seemed an easy prey, Brunswick remained
on the Rhine, and refused to co-operate with Austria in
Alsace, and Coburg was intent on gaining frontier towns. The
English government was anxious to secure its own share in the
conquests from France, and, on August 10, acting on instructions
from home, York went off with a force of 37,000 men, his
own English and German troops with 11,000 Austrians, to lay
siege to Dunkirk. About the same time Frederick William ordered
8,000 Prussian troops engaged in Flanders to withdraw
to Luxemburg, and Coburg invested Le Quesnoy.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_289" id="TOPIC_289"></a>On one side only was full advantage taken of the distress of
France. In consequence of the late disputes with Spain and
Russia the British navy was in an efficient state. Of 113 ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of the line nearly ninety were in good condition. Howe commanded
the channel fleet; he kept it at Spithead, and it did
nothing of importance during the year. The Mediterranean
fleet under Hood sailed in June and blockaded Toulon. The
insurrectionary movement at Marseilles was quelled by the
convention, and the royalists at Toulon were threatened by the
jacobin forces. Though the town was well supplied with provisions,
the chiefs of the royalist party persuaded the people that
the only way to escape starvation was to treat with the English.
The inhabitants declared for Louis XVII., the son of the late
king, and the constitution of 1791, and surrendered the town to
Hood, together with the ships in the port, thirty ships of the
line, more than a third of the whole French line of battle,
and other smaller vessels. Hood received the forts and the
ships for King Louis and promised to restore them at the end
of the war. He invited the co-operation of the Spanish fleet
under L&aacute;ngara and when it appeared entered the harbour, on
August 29. The news was received in England with delight,
and Grenville declared his belief that "the business at Toulon"
would probably be "decisive of the war". England desired the
establishment of a constitutional monarchy, and it was hoped
that the occupation of the place would strengthen the movement
in that direction in the south. The <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> Count of
Provence, the next younger brother of Louis XVI., who had
assumed the title of regent, desired the government to allow
him to enter the town. As the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> aimed at the restoration
of absolutism it would have been fatal to the hopes built
on the movement in the south in favour of a constitutional
monarchy to have granted his request, and it would have been
unfair to the Toulonese who stipulated for the acceptance of
the constitution of 1791. Besides this, the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> were strongly
opposed to the policy of conquest adopted at Antwerp; and,
though Toulon was not to be taken from France, England
could not at that time encourage the count's pretensions. His
presence in the town would have been embarrassing to Hood,
and he would certainly have interfered with the defence. England
did not acknowledge his claim to the regency, and he was
not admitted into Toulon.</p>

<p>While the allies were divided in purpose and action, the
danger of France and the violation of her territory roused the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
party in power to energy in her defence. In August the second
committee of public safety decreed a <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i>, and on
the 23rd substituted for it a universal conscription. Men were
poured into the army, but they had to be turned into soldiers;
and efficient generals, and above all a competent military administration,
had to be provided. At this crisis Carnot, who
was to earn the title of "organiser of victories," took the direction
of the war. The new troops were at first worse than useless,
but after a while they were brought to order by being
drafted into the old battalions; the amalgamation of the volunteers
with the regulars was effected early in 1794, and the army
of the revolution became a well-ordered fighting machine. While
the new levies of August, 1793, were still undisciplined Carnot's
genius began to raise the fortunes of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HONDSCHOOTE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_290" id="TOPIC_290"></a>When York marched off to the siege of Dunkirk on August
10 he divided his army into two corps, placing one, composed
of 14,500 German and Austrian troops, under Marshal Freytag,
to act as an army of observation, while he commanded the army
of the siege in person. On his march a detachment of his troops
surprised and routed a French force at Linselles while engaged
in pillaging the place. He summoned Dunkirk on the 23rd.
The fleet, which was to have bombarded the town and brought
a siege-train, had not arrived. He was only able to invest the
town on the east, for the French laid the country between
Bergues and Dunkirk under water, and the causeway from
Bergues was strongly defended. His army occupied a wretched
position, was in want of good water, and was cut off from direct
communication with Freytag, who was encamped in front of
Bergues.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> On September 6-8 Freytag's army was attacked by
a French army under Houchard of nearly four times its strength.
Walmoden, who succeeded Freytag, might have avoided the
battle of Hondschoote on the 8th; he fought in obedience to
York's orders and was defeated with heavy loss. York hastily
retreated to Furnes. If Houchard had followed up his success
he might have crushed York's army. He turned aside to attack
the Dutch quartered on the Lys and routed them at Menin.
Le Quesnoy surrendered to the Austrians on the 11th, and
Coburg invested Maubeuge. Jourdan, the new commander of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
the army of the north, and Carnot, who accompanied him, attacked
and defeated the Austrian covering army at Wattignies
on October 16, and forced Coburg to raise the siege. This
was practically the end of the campaign, which closed far more
favourably for France than it had begun.</p>

<p>On the German frontier political disunion was fatal to the
success of the allies. Frederick William believed that the emperor's
refusal to accept the partition treaty encouraged the
Poles to resist his demands. He left the army of the Rhine,
and went off to Posen to establish his rule in his new dominions,
ordering Brunswick not to engage in any operations which
might prevent him from sending him such troops as he might
call for. Wurmser, the Austrian commander, drove the French
from their lines at Weissenburg on October 13, but the limited
co-operation of the Prussian army was not enough to secure any
material progress, and finally, on December 26, Hoche inflicted
a severe defeat on the Austrians at the Geisberg. Wurmser
retreated across the Rhine, and the Prussians were forced to
abandon the greater part of the Palatinate, and withdrew to
Mainz. No French territory on the north or east remained in
the hands of the allies except Cond&eacute;, Valenciennes and Le
Quesnoy, while on the Italian frontier forward movements of
the Piedmontese had ended in failure and the King of Sardinia
was reduced to a merely defensive attitude.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_291" id="TOPIC_291"></a>The republican armies were not less successful against
domestic foes than against foreign invasion. The loss of
Mainz in July set free a large force which was used to lay
waste La Vend&eacute;e. The Vendeans applied for help to the
emigrant princes and to England. Pitt, though he would not
encourage the hopes of the princes, was willing to support a
movement which was weakening the enemy and might forward
the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Stores were
sent to Noirmoutier for the insurgents and further help was
promised. Some 80,000 Vendeans, of both sexes and all ages,
crossed the Loire, marched through Anjou, and made an attempt
on Granville, in the hope of gaining a port at which they might
receive succour from England. An expedition was prepared to
help them, and a force of 12,000 men, &eacute;migr&eacute;s, British troops,
and others under the Earl of Moira, the Lord Rawdon of the
American war, arrived off the Norman coast on December 2.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
They made signals but no answer was returned. The Vendeans
had failed before Granville and had retreated a few days before.
As they were attempting to return to their homes they were
caught by a republican force; a large number was massacred
and the rest dispersed. The English expedition returned without
accomplishing anything.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EVACUATION OF TOULON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_292" id="TOPIC_292"></a>Toulon was threatened by the republicans both on the east
and west, while on the north Lyons was closely besieged. Hood
despatched Nelson to Naples for reinforcements which were
sent by the king. Even with them the garrison, made up of
2,000 British troops, Spaniards, Sardinians, Neapolitans, and
French royalists, many of them untrained, amounted to only
about 12,000 men fit for duty, a wholly insufficient number,
for the defences were widely extended. Hood sent off four of
the French ships, full of republican prisoners, who were allowed
to return to their homes because it was inconvenient to keep
them. By the middle of September the republicans were
pressing the siege, and on October 1 the garrison under Lord
Mulgrave smartly drove them from a commanding position
which they had seized on Mont Faron. The fall of Lyons on
the 9th set free a large force to act against the place, and the
besieging army under Dugommier finally numbered 37,000
men, with artillery organised and directed by a young Corsican
officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, who since September 16 had
taken an active part in the siege. General O'Hara, then in
command in the town, was wounded and taken prisoner while
leading a sortie, and on the night of December 16-17 the
enemy forced the line of defence and planted their batteries
in commanding positions. Neither the harbour nor the town
was tenable any longer, and orders were given for the embarkation
of the troops. Of the twenty-seven French ships
of the line in the harbour, nine, together with smaller vessels,
were burnt by British seamen under Sir Sidney Smith, in spite
of a furious bombardment from the heights, and three accompanied
the retreat. The remaining fifteen were left to the
enemy, and an attempt to destroy the dockyard was only partially
successful, for time was short and the Spaniards, either
through treachery or more probably through the incompetence
of their officers, failed to accomplish their share of the work.
The English and Spanish fleets sailed on the 19th, carrying off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
some 6,000 refugees, and Hood's fleet anchored in Hy&egrave;res
bay. The remainder of the population was exposed to the
cruel vengeance of the jacobins.</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe that the government did not
intend to violate the terms of the surrender by keeping Toulon
as a British possession. As an isolated station it could not
have been defended and supplied without an enormous strain
on England's resources. Its value to Great Britain was purely
temporary; it was of incalculable importance to the enemy,
and it was expected to serve as a base for the movement in
the south against the jacobin government. The issue of the
insurrection was decided by the fall of Lyons. Hopes of a
success to be gained through French disaffection were as ill-founded
as those based on American loyalism. The ministers
pursued a mistaken policy, and pursued it weakly; for as they
believed that the occupation of Toulon was of first-rate importance,
they should have concentrated their efforts upon its defence
instead of squandering their resources by trying to do
two things at once, to co-operate with the Vendeans and to
defend Toulon, while the war on the Flemish frontier was a
constant drain on England's small army. Grenville ascribed
the disaster to the "common cause" to the failure of the
Austrian government to fulfil its promise of sending a reinforcement
of 5,000 men to the garrison.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The loss of the place
was a bitter disappointment; it was mortifying in itself, and it
declared the futility of the high hopes built on the insurrectionary
movement in the south. Reckoning it with Dunkirk and
the Vendean expedition, the government had to confess to
three failures in the year. Yet England had some grounds for
satisfaction. Tobago and the fishery islands of St. Pierre and
Miquelon were taken without difficulty, Pondicherry and the
other French factories in India were surrendered, several French
ships of war were captured in single-ship and other small combats,
and a substantial advantage was gained by the destruction
of the ships at Toulon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REPRESSION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_293" id="TOPIC_293"></a>The success of the allies in the spring of 1793 gave Fox an
opportunity for moving for the re-establishment of peace. If,
he argued, the war was undertaken to preserve Holland and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
check the aggrandisement of France, that object was attained.
France had been the aggressor; so much the more reason was
there to regard the war as purely defensive, and end it when
the aggression ended. Pitt said that he would no longer pledge
himself that England would not interfere in the internal affairs
of France. So long as the existing French government was in
power, there could be no security that the system of aggression
and propagandism would cease, or that treaties would be observed.
Fox's motion was defeated by 187 to 47. Earlier in
the session the government brought in a bill against traitorous
correspondence, to prevent intercourse with France, and specially
such acts as the purchase of French stocks, which tended to
support the enemy. Some of its provisions were unusually restrictive,
and the penalty of treason was attached to the breach
of any of them. The bill was passed without material alteration.
In spite of the strong feeling against societies believed to advocate
revolutionary principles, Grey, in accordance with his notice
of the last session, moved that the petition of the Friends of
the People for parliamentary reform should be considered. His
motion, which was supported by Fox, was defeated by 282 to 41.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_294" id="TOPIC_294"></a>Violent efforts were made by the government to crush the
effects of the French propaganda, by prosecutions for uttering,
printing, or publishing sedition. The attack was indiscriminate;
spies were employed, and idle words of obscure persons were
made grounds of indictment. Both in the superior courts and
at quarter sessions severe penalties were inflicted. One Frost,
a broken-down attorney, and a pestilent rascal enough, though
convicted merely of saying in a coffee-house that he was "for
equality and no king," was sentenced to six months' imprisonment,
to stand in the pillory, and be struck off the roll. A
dissenting preacher, found guilty of using seditious language
in the pulpit, was sentenced to fines of &pound;200 and four years'
imprisonment; and Ridgway, a bookseller in Piccadilly, was
awarded the same penalty for selling the <i>Rights of Man</i> and
two other pamphlets of a kindred tendency. In Scotland, where
the government business was managed by Dundas, the parliamentary
representation was extremely unsatisfactory; the reformers
were violent, and belonged to revolutionary societies.
The sedition cases were mostly heard before the lord-justice
clerk Braxfield, who behaved with scandalous harshness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
severity. One Muir, who had been expelled from the society
of advocates, though no offence of any magnitude was proved
against him at his trial, was condemned to fourteen years' transportation.
Three others received like sentences, and a dissenting
preacher named Palmer was transported for five years. Adam,
an eminent Scottish lawyer, contended in parliament that the
sentences on Muir and Palmer were illegal. His opinion was
traversed by Dundas and Pitt, and his motion on their behalf
was negatived by 171 to 32.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the proceedings of the corresponding
and constitutional societies were such as no settled
government could leave unpunished. Some few arms and a
mass of compromising documents were seized in Edinburgh, and
twelve of the leading members of these societies were arrested
in May, 1794. A secret committee of the commons presented
reports on seditious practices, which show that some persons
had conspired to raise an armed insurrection, and that a so-called
national convention at Edinburgh was concerned in
treasonable conspiracy. Later in the year one Watt was hanged
for engaging in a wild plot to seize Edinburgh castle and commit
other acts of treason. On the presentation of the first report
of the committee the government brought in a bill to suspend
the <i>habeas corpus</i> act. Pitt declared the matter urgent, and
the bill, which was introduced in the commons on Friday the
16th, was passed in a special sitting the next day, though not
without a struggle, Fox accusing the ministers of a design to
terrorise the people in order to shield themselves from the
condemnation which they deserved for wickedly involving the
country in a disastrous war. The opposition in the commons
did not rise in any division above 39, and the lords passed the
bill by 92 to 7. The ordinary law had hitherto proved sufficient
for the occasion, and a review of the evidence before parliament
does not appear to show adequate cause for arming the
executive with an authority so dangerous to liberty. Parliament
was alarmed, and the government shared its alarm and
yielded to its desires. A revulsion of feeling ensued. When
the prisoners arrested in May were tried for treason, the evidence
was found to be weak. The first, Hardy, a shoemaker,
was brilliantly defended by Erskine, and was acquitted. Horne
Tooke, the only one of the lot in a superior social position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
jeered at the court, and called Pitt, the Duke of Richmond, and
other great persons to give evidence as to their former connexion
with societies for parliamentary reform. He and Thelwall,
a lecturer, were acquitted, and the rest were set at liberty.
The general alarm was pacified, and people rejoiced that the
high character of the English courts of justice should have
been vindicated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_295" id="TOPIC_295"></a>When parliament met on January 21, 1794, the opposition
was able to taunt the government with the feebleness and failure
of the military operations of the past year. An amendment to
the address recommending proposals of peace was moved in
both houses. In the lords it was supported only by 12 against
97 votes, the Duke of Bedford and Lords Lansdowne, Stanhope,
and Lauderdale as usual being conspicuous in opposition to the
ministry. In the commons, Fox urged that the cruel acts of the
jacobin government should not prevent England from negotiating
with it, to which Pitt replied that no dependence could be
placed on the existing French government, and that "any alternative
was preferable to making peace with France upon the system
of its present rulers". The address was carried by 277 to 59.
Votes were passed for 60,000 regular troops and a naval force of
85,000 men. Weak as the opposition was, it lost no opportunity.
Some Hessian troops sent to join a British force arrived off the
Isle of Wight before the expedition was ready, and were landed
for a short time to prevent them from suffering from sickness.
The opposition maintained that this was a violation of the bill
of rights and the act of settlement. It was easily shown that
the law had not been violated and that the course pursued was
not irregular, and both lords and commons declined to allow
that the matter called for an act of indemnity. Compared with
the trifling nature of the occurrence, the fuss made over it by
the opposition can only be explained by a desire to impede the
government in the performance of its duty at a time of national
danger. An invasion was threatened. The defence of England,
Grenville said, would best be secured by her "water-guard".
It was further provided for by raising volunteers.
Dundas wrote to the lord-lieutenants of counties, recommending
subscriptions towards the expenses of the movement. Fox and
Sheridan declared that this recommendation was illegal. Their
contention that it was a demand for "benevolences" was absurd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Yet a request by the government for money, not addressed to
the house of commons, seems contrary to the spirit of the constitution.
Nor did the safety of the state, which would outweigh
all such considerations, require the step. But the matter
was of no practical importance and the action of the government
was approved by parliament.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_296" id="TOPIC_296"></a>As Frederick William was evidently withdrawing from the
war, Malmesbury was sent to Berlin, late in 1793, to persuade
him to continue it. He would not do so at his own expense,
and it was proposed that the allies should pay him to keep
100,000 men in the field. Thugut objected; Austria could not
pay her share and it would be better for Europe and for Austria
that the king should stay in Prussia than lead so large an army
to the Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> This upset the arrangement. England wanted a
strong force on the frontier of the Austrian Netherlands, and at
last, on April 19, a treaty was signed by which Frederick William
agreed to furnish 62,400 men to act with the armies of Great
Britain and Holland "wherever it shall be judged most suitable
to the interests of the two maritime powers," all conquests being
at their disposal, on consideration of &pound;50,000 a month, and
&pound;300,000 at the beginning, and &pound;100,000 at the end of the
campaign, with bread and forage money. Of these sums
&pound;400,000 was to be paid by Holland and the rest by England.
Mack, the Austrian quartermaster-general, came to London
and laid a plan of campaign before the ministers. It was decided
that the Austrian and British armies should widen the
breach made in the line of French fortresses, should march on
Cambrai and then perhaps on Paris, supported by an advance
of the Prussians from the Moselle, under M&ouml;llendorf, who had
succeeded Brunswick in command. Prompted by Mack, who
was then generally believed to be a strategist of supreme skill,
the ministers expressed dissatisfaction with Coburg, and as
difficulties arose with respect to the command,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> the emperor
took the ostensible command himself and came to Brussels on
April 2.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND'S ALLIES.</i></div>

<p>The campaign opened well. The allies invested Landrecies,
and an attempt to turn the British position at Cateau was re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>pulsed
by a brilliant charge of the 15th light dragoons; a more
serious effort to raise the siege failed, and Landrecies capitulated
on the 30th. The Austrians under Clairfait, however, were defeated
at Mouscron. York marched to Tournai and the allies
attempted by a series of combined movements to cut off the
French in West Flanders from their communications with Lille.
Their plan was wrecked by their utter defeat at Tourcoing on
May 16, where the British suffered heavily. The French attacked
the camp near Tournai on the 23rd with the object of
forcing the line of the Scheldt, but were foiled, and the British
infantry highly distinguished themselves by their gallant recapture
of the post at Pont-&agrave;-chin. Prussian help was urgently
needed for the protection of the Netherlands, and, though paid
for by English gold, was not forthcoming. A formidable insurrection
broke out in Poland, and Frederick William marched
to quell it, ordering M&ouml;llendorf to confine himself to the defence
of the empire. Malmesbury and Cornwallis went to Mainz and
urged M&ouml;llendorf to proceed to Flanders; nothing would move
him. The emperor was more anxious about his interests in
Poland than the defence of the Netherlands, and returned to
Vienna. On June 26, Coburg was defeated by Jourdan at
Fleurus and rapidly retired on Waterloo. On July 11, the
French entered Brussels. The Austrians retreated to the Meuse,
and York's corps to Malines where it was joined by 7,000 men
under Lord Moira, who had landed at Ostend on June 26. Disgusted
at the supineness of the Austrians, who were leaving the
British and Dutch to their fate, the English government insisted
that Coburg should be superseded.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> They urged the emperor
to make an effort to reconquer the Netherlands. Thugut replied
that Austria had no money, that the Netherlands were
more important to England and Holland than to the emperor,
who did not get &pound;200 a year from them, and that the Prussian
subsidy ought to be transferred to Austria, or a large loan
guaranteed.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Austria was set on her interests in Poland, and
it is scarcely too much to say that she virtually betrayed the
common cause.</p>

<p>These negotiations were brought to an end by the success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
of the French arms in Germany. The Austrians retreated
across the Rhine in October, and England was not going to
pay for the defence of the empire. The useless subsidy to
Prussia was stopped on the 17th, and M&ouml;llendorf withdrew his
army across the Rhine. Meanwhile York's army had fallen
back on the line of Dutch fortresses; it was driven across the
Meuse, was forced to retreat from Nimeguen, and encamped
behind the Waal. Dissatisfied with his generalship, Pitt, as
early as October 11, represented to the king that the division
of command between him and the Prince of Orange was mischievous,
and suggested that some experienced general should
be sent out. George, who was deeply attached to his son,
seems to have put the suggestion aside, for on November 23,
Pitt wrote again insisting on the duke's recall. The king,
though "very much hurt" was forced to yield and the command-in-chief
devolved on General Walmoden.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> York had shown
himself a gallant soldier and had already proved his capacity
as a military administrator, but he was not equal to the command
of an army in the field.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_297" id="TOPIC_297"></a>The first attempt of the French on the line of the Waal
was smartly repulsed by Sir David Dundas on January 4, 1795,
but they crossed in large force a week later, and the British
fell back. The line of the Lek was abandoned and the province
of Utrecht evacuated. As the French advanced, their party
among the Dutch gathered strength; the stadholder fled to
England, the Dutch troops separated from the British, Amsterdam
received the invaders, and on the 30th the Dutch fleet,
which lay frozen up in the Texel, was captured by French
cavalry. Meanwhile the British suffered terribly from the severe
cold; and their sick and wounded were often exposed to ill-treatment
by the people. The government decided to withdraw
the army and bring it back by Bremen. It retreated across
the Yssel and by the end of February evacuated the United
Provinces and entered Westphalia by way of Enschede. Westphalia
was held by M&ouml;llendorf's army, and the British troops,
worn out by sickness and privations, were embarked at Bremen
on April 12.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEFECTIONS FROM THE COALITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_298" id="TOPIC_298"></a>By the end of 1794 the French were everywhere victorious
on land. They were masters of the Netherlands and were
over-running Holland; they held all the country to the left of
the Rhine except Mainz and Luxemburg; a victorious French
army wintered in Catalonia; the passes of the maritime Alps
were opened, and the Piedmontese were driven back from Mont
Cenis and the Little St. Bernard. The states-general proclaimed
the establishment of the Batavian republic, and a treaty
with France signed on May 16 placed the Dutch in a position
of virtual dependence. Frederick William, anxious to forward
his interests in Poland, had abandoned the war, and was turning
towards peace with France. The spoliation of Poland, which
exercised so deadly an effect on the fortunes of the coalition, was
completed in January, 1795, when Russia divided the remainder of
the country between herself, Austria, and Prussia by an arrangement
confirmed by treaties later in the year. The coalition
suffered from further defections. The Grand-duke of Tuscany,
who was compelled by Hood's fleet to break off intercourse with
the republic in the summer of 1793, was restored to his former
state of neutrality by a treaty with France. Spain also was deserting
the coalition. Godoy, the lover of the queen of Charles IV.,
who controlled the policy of the court, opened negotiations with
France before the end of 1794. Among the questions which
retarded their progress was the fate of the Spanish king's
young kinsman, the dauphin, or Louis XVII. Death released
the poor boy from his misery in June. The French entered
Vittoria and were preparing for the siege of Pampeluna. Their
successes hastened matters; the treaty with France was concluded
on July 22, 1795, and the minion Godoy was saluted as
"Prince of the Peace". Pitt's coalition was well-nigh ruined.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_299" id="TOPIC_299"></a>While the year 1794 saw the hopes of England frustrated on
the continent, she was victorious at sea. Acting on overtures
from Paoli, Hood attacked the French in Corsica, and sent
Nelson to blockade Bastia, which was surrendered on May 22.
Calvi was besieged by a military force under General Stuart
and by Nelson, who lost his right eye there. Its capitulation,
on August 10, completed the conquest of the island. In the
West Indies a squadron under Sir John Jervis and troops commanded
by Sir Charles, afterwards the first Earl Grey, compelled
the surrender of Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadaloupe with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Mariegalante. Port-au-Prince and harbours important to the
Jamaica trade were also taken in the French part of San
Domingo. But the British force was insufficient for all that
it had to do in the West Indies. French troops landed in
Guadaloupe during the absence of Jervis and Grey, were
welcomed by a large part of the creole population, and after
a long struggle forced the British to evacuate the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GLORIOUS FIRST OF JUNE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_300" id="TOPIC_300"></a>England's maritime strength, combined with a bad harvest,
war, and insurrection, caused a scarcity of food in France which
threatened to amount to a famine. A fleet of merchant ships
laden with provisions was anxiously expected from America,
and a convoying squadron was sent to bring it over. The
channel fleet, thirty-four ships of the line and fifteen frigates,
under Howe, sailed on May 2 with 148 merchantmen bound
for different parts. Howe despatched the merchantmen and
their convoys under Admiral Montagu, with orders that after
Montagu had convoyed the merchantmen a certain distance,
he was to cruise about with six ships of the line and look
out for the provision ships. Their safe arrival was vital to
France, and Rear-admiral Villaret-Joyeuse sailed with the Brest
fleet to bring them in. As soon as Howe found that the
French fleet had sailed, he determined to strike at the main
force of the enemy. He sighted the French to windward on
the 28th, about 400 miles west of Ushant. Their fleet consisted
of twenty-six ships of the line, the same number as his own.
He at once sent four of his fastest ships to get to windward of
them, and attack their rear. A partial action took place in
which the <i>R&eacute;volutionnaire</i> (110) was utterly disabled, and her
last assailant, the <i>Audacious</i> (74), was so crippled that she went
home. On the 29th Howe planned to obtain the weather-gage
and to deliver a concentrated attack on the rear of the enemy.
He took his flagship, the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> (100), through
the French line, and was followed by two others. Villaret
man&oelig;uvred skilfully, but three of his ships were badly damaged.
The result of Howe's admirable tactics during these two days
was that four French ships were forced to leave the fleet, and
another had to be towed by a consort, and that he won the
windward position and so was enabled to force an action. On
the 30th there was a thick fog, and during the day the French
received a reinforcement of four ships, giving them the advan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>tage
of one over the British. The fog cleared at noon on the
31st; the British fleet came up with the enemy, then to leeward,
and "near sunset" formed the line of battle.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, June 1, a fresh breeze blowing south
by west, the two fleets lay in parallel lines, the leading British
ship being opposite to the seventh of the French fleet. The
British having formed on the larboard line of bearing, Howe
brought them down slantwise on the enemy, apparently intending
that each ship should pass across the stern of her opponent,
rake her, and engage to leeward. Unlike Rodney in the battle
of the Saints, he deliberately adopted the man&oelig;uvre of breaking
the line, and planned that his ships should fight to leeward
instead of to windward, and so bar the crippled ships of the
enemy from getting away. As the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> bore down,
he bade the master, Bowen, lay her as close as he could to
Villaret's flagship, the <i>Montagne</i> (120). Bowen brought her
so close round the Frenchman's stern that the tricolour ensign
flapped against her shrouds, and as she passed she raked her
gigantic enemy from stern to stem with her larboard broadside
to such effect that the <i>Montagne</i> lost 300 killed and wounded
before she could make reply. Six British ships broke through
the line and engaged to leeward; the others remained to windward,
the captains perhaps not fully understanding Howe's plan.</p>

<p>As the <i>Brunswick</i> (74) tried to force her way through the
French line, her anchors caught in the rigging of the <i>Vengeur
du Peuple</i> (74), and the two ships drifted side by side in deadly
embrace for three hours. When at last they parted the <i>Brunswick</i>
had received much damage and lost 158 men, including
her captain, who was mortally wounded. The <i>Vengeur</i> was a
wreck. A broadside from the <i>Ramillies</i> (74) finished her. She
"hauled her colours down and displayed a Union Jack over her
quarter, and hailed for quarter having struck, her masts going
soon after, and a-sinking".<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The <i>Alfred</i> (74) sent an officer
aboard her, and the boats of three English ships saved about
333 of her crew. The "rest went down with her". The flatulent
account of her end, given by Barr&egrave;re in the convention, is
largely imaginary. The crew of the <i>Vengeur</i> did not choose
death rather than the surrender of their ship. Some of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
whom the efforts of the British seamen failed to save, went
down with a cry of <i>Vive la r&eacute;publique</i>! They had surrendered
after a hard-fought fight, and they died as gallant seamen die.
The battle of "the glorious first of June" ended in the complete
victory of the British fleet. Six French ships were taken besides
the <i>Vengeur</i>; five dismasted and several crippled ships were
brought away by Villaret. Howe might easily have secured
more prizes, but he was an old man, and was completely worn
out by the fatigue and anxiety of the last five days. His tactics
were splendid, though the detaching of part of his fleet under
Montagu was a strategic mistake. The provision ships got
safely into Brest, but the French purchased their food at the
cost of their fleet.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_301" id="TOPIC_301"></a>In July the whigs who supported Pitt coalesced with the
government. A third secretaryship of state was again instituted.
Grenville remained foreign secretary; the Duke of Portland,
the nominal head of the seceding whigs, took the home
department, with the colonies, and Dundas retained the conduct
of the war as secretary of state for war. Earl Fitzwilliam
became president of the council, and was promised the vice-royalty
of Ireland as soon as a suitable place was found for the
present lord lieutenant, the Earl of Westmorland. The Marquis
of Stafford resigned the privy seal, which was given to
Earl Spencer, and Windham entered the cabinet as secretary-at-war,
though his office was not then considered as one of
cabinet rank. Burke retired from parliament at the close of the
trial of Hastings, and, as he was in straitened circumstances,
accepted two pensions of &pound;1,200 and &pound;2,500. The death of his
only son clouded the last years of his noble life. Two later
changes in office were salutary. Pitt had the unpleasant duty
of urging the king to remove his brother Chatham from the
admiralty;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> he resigned on December 20, was succeeded as first
lord by Earl Spencer, an excellent appointment, and succeeded
Spencer as privy seal, an office more suited to his temperament
and talents. The Duke of Richmond was held to be inefficient
as master of the ordnance; the new ministers insisted on his
removal, and he was succeeded on February 13, 1795, by Cornwallis.
At the same time the king appointed his son York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
field-marshal on the staff; he became commander-in-chief in
1798, but at no time had a seat in the cabinet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE IRISH CATHOLIC QUESTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_302" id="TOPIC_302"></a>These accessions and changes strengthened the ministry.
For a time, however, the new ministers recruited from the
whigs were inclined to act as a party on questions concerning
office. This caused some trouble in the cabinet, specially in
connexion with Ireland. Although the trade of Ireland was
increased by the removal of restrictions, its agriculture stimulated
by bounties on exported corn, and its manufactures and
other resources enlarged by parliamentary grants and wise
legislation, its political condition was unsatisfactory. It needed
a reform of parliament, the admission of catholics to political
power, the overthrow of the system by which the castle secured
power by the distribution of pensions and offices, and a change
in the tithe law. The Earl of Westmorland had succeeded
Buckingham as lord-lieutenant in 1790. Round him stood a
group of ministers, bishops, and great lords opposed to any
changes. Revolutionary principles gained ground among the
people. The society of United Irishmen, founded by Wolfe
Tone, a lawyer, in 1791, aimed at uniting protestants and catholics
for the purpose of overthrowing the English ascendency
and effecting a reform of parliament of a democratic kind.
While religious animosity was dying out among the upper
classes, it was rife among the peasantry, and catholic "defenders"
and protestant "peep of day boys" were at constant
war. The catholics still suffered from many disabilities. Their
hopes of relief were encouraged by the English relief act of
1791, and by the advocacy of Burke, who in his <i>Letter to Sir
Hercules Langrishe</i> (1792), argued against the monopoly of
power by the protestants, and allowed his son to act as the
professional adviser of the catholic committee. The English
ministers favoured the catholics, and dreaded an alliance between
them and the democratic party among the protestants,
which would bring them over to join in the demand for parliamentary
reform.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_303" id="TOPIC_303"></a>Dundas urged the Irish government to assent to the enfranchisement
of the catholics on grounds both of justice and
expediency. Westmorland and his advisers objected. Pitt recommended
them to give way, and wrote that in any case they
must not deprive the catholics of hope. In a letter to West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>morland
he pointed out that no danger could possibly arise
from enfranchisement if Ireland were united to England, a plan
which, he said, had long been in his mind.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The Irish government
yielded, and a bill granting the catholics the suffrage and
other relief became law in April, 1793. They were still shut out
from parliament and from high offices of state. The measure
was ill-conceived, for while it conferred political power upon the
poor and ignorant catholics, it left the catholic gentry, a loyal
and conservative body, debarred from exercising the influence
to which their position entitled them. On the outbreak of the
war Grattan supported the government; and parliament voted
liberal supplies for the army and navy, and passed a bill establishing
an Irish militia of the same kind as that of England.
The country was disturbed by troubles over the compulsory
enlistment for the militia and by the lawlessness of the defenders.
A period of comparative quiet, however, followed
the relief act, and the rejection of a moderate reform bill in
1794 created no disturbance. Nevertheless secret disloyalty
increased, and Tone and some of his allies held seditious correspondence
with France.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The United Irishmen grew in
numbers, for while the leaders, Tone, Emmet, and Rowan were
protestants, they were joined by many catholics. On the other
hand, Grattan and his party, supported by most of the protestant
and many of the catholic gentry, though anxious for
reforms and specially for the complete repeal of the catholic
disabilities, were strongly opposed to the democratic movement
and were loyal to the constitution of 1782.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FITZWILLIAM AS VICEROY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_304" id="TOPIC_304"></a>Their hopes were raised by the prospect of the speedy appointment
of Fitzwilliam as lord-lieutenant, which seemed to
promise a change of system favourable to the hopes of the Irish
whigs. On taking office as president of the council in July,
Fitzwilliam, in common with Portland, to whose department
Ireland belonged, thought that he was to succeed Westmorland
without delay; he appointed his chief secretary and openly entered
into communications with Grattan and Ponsonby which
implied extensive changes both of men and measures.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Irish were delighted. Pitt, however, did not mean to give
Ireland over to Portland and Fitzwilliam. Unfortunately he
let matters slide; though he did not recall Westmorland, he
abstained from checking Fitzwilliam's somewhat premature
proceedings. In October, Portland pressed for Fitzwilliam's
immediate appointment. Pitt then said that he would not consent
to a change of system, and specially not to the dismissal of the
chancellor, Fitzgibbon, and would not recall Westmorland until
he had a suitable place to offer him. A serious quarrel ensued
between him and the new ministers of Portland's party. At
last a compromise was effected. A court office was found for
Westmorland. Fitzwilliam in an interview with Pitt and other
ministers disavowed all idea of a general change of system,
agreed to some arrangements with regard to appointments, and
was instructed to prevent, if possible, the agitation of the catholic
question during the coming session, though if he could not
evade it he was to be at liberty to give the measure his full
support.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Pitt was favourable to catholic emancipation, but
wished to have no changes during the war. Fitzwilliam received
his appointment and was succeeded as president of the council
by the Earl of Mansfield.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FITZWILLIAM RECALLED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_305" id="TOPIC_305"></a>He landed in Ireland on January 4, 1795. His appointment
had inspired the catholic committee with fresh vigour,
and he found that the catholics were united on the question of
a complete removal of disabilities and that the mass of the protestant
gentry favoured their demand. Defenderism was active
and the country was in a disturbed state. He informed the
cabinet that the catholic question was urgent. Parliament met
and in a loyal humour voted large supplies for the war. Grattan
undertook the catholic business, and Fitzwilliam promised his
support, and pressed for the approval of the cabinet on the
ground that a complete repeal of all disqualifying laws was
necessary in order to secure the pacification and loyalty of the
country. No answer was sent to his appeals. Meanwhile Fitzwilliam
dismissed some administrative officers and among them
Beresford, a powerful member of the party which had so long
been preponderant at the castle. Beresford carried his complaint
to London, and Pitt remonstrated with Fitzwilliam on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
his dismissal. Portland, too, at last wrote, warning him not to
commit himself on the catholic question. It was too late. Portland
wrote again and declared himself hostile to emancipation.
Fitzwilliam expostulated in vain, and finally, on February 23,
the cabinet agreed to recall him. He left Ireland on March
25. It was a day of general gloom; the Dublin tradesmen
put up their shutters, no business was transacted, and many
persons wore mourning. The hopes of Ireland were bitterly
disappointed and the door seemed shut against reforms by
constitutional means. Lord Camden was appointed lord-lieutenant,
the catholic bill was rejected, Fitzgibbon was made
Earl of Clare, and the party in favour of the protestant ascendency
was re-established in power. Whether the presence
of catholics in the parliament would have led to such a thorough
removal of the causes of Irish discontent as would have pacified
the country and saved it from the rebellion of 1798 seems extremely
doubtful, but it is certain that the recall of Fitzwilliam
was fatal to any chance of so happy a settlement.</p>

<p>Although he acted hastily and unadvisedly as regards the
dismissals, he was right in saying that it was impossible for him
to stave off the catholic claims, and that no measures would secure
the loyalty of the catholics or the peace of Ireland unless they
were satisfied. As Pitt desired to defer emancipation to an uncertain
date, the end of the war, he should not have excited the
expectation of the Irish by an appointment which they naturally
interpreted as a sign of immediate acquiescence. Fitzwilliam,
before his actual appointment, was allowed to commit himself to
a line of conduct to which Pitt afterwards objected; his instructions
were somewhat vague, and he did not receive timely notice
that the cabinet would not assent to the policy he was adopting.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Deeply immersed in the conduct of the war, Pitt seems to have
neglected the affairs of Ireland at this time, and to have failed
to appreciate the gravity of the crisis. Fitzwilliam's recall was
due partly to Pitt's unwillingness to offend Beresford's powerful
friends in both countries and the whole party which had given
him valuable support,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> partly to his determination to avoid any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
change of system during the war, and partly to the dislike of
some other members of the cabinet, plainly expressed by Portland,
to the proposed overthrow of the protestant ascendency.
Yet another influence was brought to bear on the decision of
the cabinet. On February 6 the king sent Pitt a statement of
his strong objection to emancipation, both as a matter of policy
and on religious grounds, ending with the remark that it would
be better to change the new Irish administration than to submit
to it.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> His feelings were strengthened by hearing, perhaps from
Westmorland, that Fitzgibbon was of opinion that he could not
give the royal assent to catholic emancipation without a breach of
his coronation oath and of the act of succession,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> a mistaken idea
which ruled his later conduct with lamentable results. He consulted
some great lawyers on the point; Lord Kenyon and
Scott, the attorney-general, assured him that he could assent to
a change in the test act without breach of his oath, but the
chancellor, Loughborough, gave him an undecided answer which
tended to strengthen his opinion. His feelings on the question
doubtless confirmed the ministers in their decision, but must not
be supposed to have dictated it.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>ENGLAND'S DARKEST DAYS.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_306" id="TOPIC_306"></a>Before parliament met on December 30, 1794, a change in the
public affairs of France encouraged hopes of peace in England.
The fall of Robespierre and the end of the Terror on July 28
(10th Thermidor) were followed by a reaction; the revolutionary
committees lost their dictatorial power, the convention regained
its supremacy, and the jacobin club was closed. This reaction,
combined with the success of the French arms in the Netherlands
and Holland, the decay of the coalition, the burdens entailed
by the war, and the conviction that the republican government
would gain in stability by foreign opposition, led some of Pitt's
followers to desire an attempt at negotiation. The king's speech
urged a vigorous prosecution of the war, and was ably seconded
in the commons by a young member, George Canning, one of
Pitt's devoted adherents. Pitt's friend, Wilberforce, moved an
amendment for opening negotiations, and the minority against
the government was 73. Soon afterwards in two divisions, arising
out of a resolution moved by Grey in January, 1795, the minority
rose to 86 and 90. As in these divisions the minority included
some of Pitt's regular supporters, they are highly significant. As
regards domestic affairs the opposition remained in its normal
condition. A motion for the repeal of the <i>habeas corpus</i> suspension
act, which led to a debate on the late trials for treason,
was defeated by 239 to 41, and attacks on the government with
reference to the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam were easily foiled by
the assertion of the right of the crown to dismiss its confidential
servants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PRINCE OF WALES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_307" id="TOPIC_307"></a>The affairs of the Prince of Wales again demanded the
attention of parliament. He had not mended his ways since
1787; his creditors pressed him and put executions in his house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
He could no longer reckon on the support of the opposition in
any application to parliament, for he had voted against them on
the seditious publications bill in 1792. In order to escape from
his difficulties he promised the king to marry Caroline, daughter
of the Duke of Brunswick. She was brought over to England
by Lord Malmesbury, and though at his first interview with her
the prince did not conceal his disgust, the marriage took place on
April 8. Pitt brought a royal message to the commons requesting
in humble terms that they would enable the prince to pay
his debts and would make a provision for him and the princess.
He stated the prince's debts at about &pound;630,000, and proposed
that the princess should have a jointure of &pound;50,000 a year, that
the prince's income should be increased by &pound;65,000, making it
&pound;125,000 a year, exclusive of the duchy of Cornwall, and that
&pound;25,000 a year should be deducted for the interest on his debts,
and the revenues of the duchy appropriated for the gradual
payment of them. Grey moved that the increase should only
be &pound;40,000. Fox reminded the house that in 1787 the prince
promised that he would not again apply to parliament for payment
of his debts, and suggested that the augmentation of
&pound;65,000 and the income of the duchy should be used for the
purpose. Pitt's proposals were carried. The princess, a coarse-minded
and giddy young woman, was shamefully treated by
her husband, and after the birth of their daughter, the Princess
Charlotte, in January, 1796, they finally separated.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_308" id="TOPIC_308"></a>For the prosecution of the war parliament voted 100,000
seamen, including marines, and &pound;14,500,000 for army expenses;
the total supplies were about &pound;27,500,000. Ten new taxes were
imposed, one of them on hair-powder at twenty-one shillings
a head, which was calculated at &pound;210,000; and a loan of
&pound;18,000,000 was effected. With this year began a period of
difficulty in raising money and the loan was only obtained
at the total rate of &pound;4 16s. 2d. per cent. In February Pitt
hoped to prevent Prussia from making peace with France, and
to induce the king to renew the war by the grant of another
subsidy. Grenville, who was convinced that no reliance could
be placed on Prussia, objected and threatened to resign if Pitt
persisted in his plan. He desired a close alliance with Austria,
and believed that the grant of a subsidy to Prussia would
alienate the courts of Vienna and St. Petersburg. Pitt would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
not give way, and Grenville promised to keep his intended
resignation a secret until the end of the session. He privately
announced his resignation to the king, who, though he had at
first been opposed to a Prussian subsidy, was then on Pitt's
side, for he was discouraged by the ill-success of Austria. <a name="TOPIC_309" id="TOPIC_309"></a>Pitt's
project came to naught; for on April 5 Frederick William
made a treaty with France at Basle, by which he surrendered
the Prussian territories on the left bank of the Rhine. Secret
articles provided that if France kept those territories he should
be indemnified elsewhere. Grenville continued in office; Pitt
had cause to rejoice that he was saved from a serious mistake,
and the threatened disruption of the cabinet remained a secret.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_310" id="TOPIC_310"></a>George himself had advised Grenville in December, 1794,
to persuade Austria to renew the war by granting her a subsidy
or a loan. His advice was in accordance with Grenville's own
wishes. An arrangement with Catherine of Russia determined
the Austrian emperor to carry on the war, with the intention
of indemnifying himself at the expense of Bavaria and Venice,
if he was unable to recover the Netherlands and conquer Lorraine
and Alsace, and England had to find him money. By
a convention signed on May 4 the government guaranteed a
loan of &pound;4,600,000 to be raised in London, to enable him to
employ an army of 200,000 men. Defensive treaties were also
concluded with Russia and Austria, and a triple alliance was
formed in virtue of which Russia sent subsidies to Austria; for
Catherine would take no part in the war by land. The imperial
loan, which in 1798 became a charge on the consolidated fund,
was raised at the rate of 7&frac12; per cent. It was unsuccessfully
opposed by Fox, who argued against the general policy of
making grants to foreign powers, whether by way of loans
or subsidies, and pointed out that the only real difference
between a loan and a subsidy was that, in the case of a loan
England would not be able to get rid of the payment, whereas
a monthly subsidy could be stopped if the contract was broken.</p>

<p>In Germany the war was not marked by any great event.
France was much distressed by domestic troubles. Public credit
failed; and Pitt, speaking on Grey's motion for peace, argued
that France was near the end of her resources. Food was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
scarce and half Paris was only kept alive by distributions of
bread and meat at low prices. The jacobins of Paris were
crushed by the thermidoriens, and in the south-east a sanguinary
movement of the enemies of the republic, the "white terror,"
pursued its course unchecked. In August a new constitution
was adopted of a far less democratic character than that of 1793;
the executive was vested in a directory of five and the legislative
in two assemblies. An insurrection in Paris on October 5 was
quelled mainly by the fire of a few cannon under the command
of Bonaparte, and the revolution assumed an organised and
settled form. Three years of war had brought Austria also to
a state of exhaustion. Active operations, therefore, did not begin
until late. Luxemburg surrendered after a blockade; and in the
autumn Jourdan and Pichegru led two armies across the Rhine
at different points. Jourdan drove the Austrians back and invested
Mainz; Pichegru occupied Mannheim. Clairfait, however,
forced Jourdan to abandon the siege of Mainz and cut the
two French generals off from one another. Mannheim was
retaken and both the French armies were pushed back across
the Rhine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A LOST OPPORTUNITY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_311" id="TOPIC_311"></a>In the war on the Italian frontier the British fleet in the
Mediterranean bore some part. In Hood's absence it was commanded
by Admiral Hotham, a distinguished officer, though
lacking in dash and resolution. The French threatened Corsica
with their Toulon fleet. Hotham engaged them on March 13
and 14, and cut off their two rearmost ships, but in Nelson's
opinion lost an opportunity of destroying the whole fleet. The
attempt on Corsica, however, was abandoned. Both fleets were
reinforced; for the watch on Brest was slackly kept and six
ships were allowed to leave the port and sail to Toulon. Another
engagement in Hy&egrave;res bay on July 13 only resulted in the
destruction of one French ship, and was another lost opportunity.
The command of the sea, which would have carried
with it the control of the Italian states, was not secured. Meanwhile
an Austrian army, acting with the Sardinians and relying
on the co-operation of the British fleet, forced the French to
evacuate Vado. The two armies faced one another, the Austrians
waiting until the French should be compelled to retire by want
of provisions; for as they were cut off from Genoa they depended
on supplies by sea. Hotham detached Nelson with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
small squadron to intercept their supplies and co-operate with
the Austrians. He performed his duty with characteristic energy,
but the ships which Hotham allowed him were too few for the
work he had to do. The French army was strongly reinforced
and was supplied by coasting vessels. The allies were totally
defeated in the battle of Loano on November 23. The Austrians
retreated beyond the Apennines, and the French had no further
difficulty in obtaining provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>QUIBERON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_312" id="TOPIC_312"></a>Before the end of 1794 Pitt was persuaded by the Count de
Puisaye, a leader of the Breton Chouans, to send an expedition
to support them. The expeditionary force was to consist of
French emigrants headed by the Count of Artois, the youngest
brother of Louis XVI. Emigrants were enlisted in England
and from the force lately serving on the Rhine, and the government
supplied arms and money. It was hoped that an unexpected
descent on the coast would enable the royalists in the
west to gain an immediate success, which was to be followed up
by an invasion of a British force under Lord Moira. The plan
became known, and in June it was necessary to act at once.
The first body of emigrants, about 3,500 men, under Puisaye
and Hervilly, with large supplies of all kinds and specially
of arms for future recruits, sailed on the 16th in a squadron
commanded by Sir John Warren. The Brest fleet was on the
watch for them, and Warren sent for help to Lord Bridport,
then in command of the channel fleet. Bridport caught the
French, who were inferior in strength, off the Ile de Groix and
captured three of their line of battle, but allowed the rest to
escape into L'Orient. On the 27th the emigrants were landed
on the peninsula of Quiberon and, with some help from the
squadron, took the fortress of Penthi&egrave;vre which commanded it.
A large number of Chouans joined them and arms were distributed
among the peasantry.</p>

<p>Puisaye and Hervilly quarrelled. Time was wasted, and
Hoche, who was in command in Brittany, drove in the Chouans
from their advanced posts and shut the whole force up in the
peninsula. They made an attempt to break out on July 16;
Hervilly was wounded and his troops retreated under cover of
the fire from British gunboats. A second party landed under
Sombreuil. More quarrelling ensued and then treachery, for
Hervilly had enlisted some who were republicans at heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
These men betrayed their companions, and with their help
Hoche stormed the fort of Penthi&egrave;vre, and fell on the royalists
in the peninsula. Many were slaughtered; others fled. It
blew hard, and for a time the British ships could do little for
the fugitives. At last they were able to take off Puisaye and
some 3,500 others. Sombreuil and about a thousand under
him were cut off, and laid down their arms. Sombreuil was
tried and executed at Vannes, and over 700 were shot in batches
on successive days in a field near Auray. The fugitives were
landed on the islands of Houat and H&aelig;dik which were covered
by the squadron. Then the Count of Artois with a third
division of the expedition and a body of British troops appeared,
took possession of the Ile d'Yeu, and seemed about to
cross over to the mainland to co-operate with the Vendeans.
However nothing further was done of any importance, and in
October the troops were embarked for England. The Vendeans,
who had hoped in vain to receive help, and to be headed
by Artois, were again crushed, and the only result of this ill-planned
and deplorable expedition was the ruin of the royalist
cause in the west.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_313" id="TOPIC_313"></a>Nor were events cheering in the West Indies during 1795.
The reconquest of Guadaloupe, due to the insufficiency of the
British force sent out in 1794, led to disastrous consequences.
The French firmly established themselves in the island and
made it a centre for operations, St. Lucia was taken, and insurrections
of French inhabitants, negroes, and native races were
fomented and supported in St. Vincent's, Grenada, and Dominica.
An insurrection of the Maroons caused much trouble
in Jamaica, and the government of the island imported bloodhounds
from Cuba to track the fugitive insurgents. Great
indignation was expressed in parliament at this measure, and it
was asserted that the dogs tore the natives in pieces. Dundas
explained that the home government was not responsible for
the importation of the dogs, and promised that if they were
used for such a horrid purpose the practice should be stopped.
In 1796 a large force was sent to the West Indies under Sir
Ralph Abercromby and Admiral Christian. St. Lucia was
retaken and the British power re-established in the Antilles.
The French, however, retained Guadaloupe, and privateers both
from that island and Cuba did much damage to the West India<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
trade. England gained largely by the alliance between Holland
and France, for it threw the Dutch colonies open to attack.
Their rich settlements in Ceylon, Malacca, and on the Malabar
coast; the Cape (September, 1795); Demarara, Essequibo, and
the Moluccas (1796) were taken without difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_314" id="TOPIC_314"></a>England's naval power was already forwarding the increase
of her trade, and the total loss of commerce with France, Holland,
and the Belgian Netherlands was more than counterbalanced
by its increase with Germany, Russia, and the United
States. With the United States some serious difficulties with
respect to neutral rights were happily settled in 1794 by a treaty
which was negotiated on their part by Jay, and finally ratified
in 1796. Yet the year 1795 was one of great distress among
the poor. Two bad harvests in succession raised the average
price of wheat, which in 1792 had been 43s., to 75s. 2d. Bread
riots broke out in Sussex, in Birmingham, Nottingham,
Coventry, and other places. Bills were passed with the object
of husbanding the supply of wheat; liberal bounties were granted
on importation, and the members of parliament entered into
an agreement to curtail the use of wheaten flour in their own
households. A bill for the regulation of wages, introduced by
Whitbread, the brewer, and advocated by Fox, was opposed
by Pitt and was rejected. Starving men are quick to believe
assertions that their sufferings are caused by ill-government,
and the corresponding society, encouraged by the failure of
the prosecutions in 1794, was active in spreading political discontent.
At a large meeting held in St. George's Fields on
July 29, an address to the king was voted and resolutions
were passed demanding annual parliaments, universal suffrage,
and above all peace, as remedies for the high price of food.
Parliament was summoned for October 29. On the 26th, a
meeting in Copenhagen Fields, Mary-le-bone, at which 150,000
persons are said to have been present, adopted a strongly
worded "remonstrance" to the king, praying for parliamentary
reform, the dismissal of the ministers, and a speedy peace.
When the king went to open parliament a large crowd greeted
him with hisses and cries of "Bread! Peace! No Pitt!" His
carriage was pelted, and a missile, probably from an air-gun,
broke the glass. On his return the same cries were raised;
there was more pelting, and the king was only rescued from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
the crowd by the arrival of some horse-guards. George, than
whom no braver man lived in his dominions, remained perfectly
calm throughout these scenes, read the royal speech
without a sign of excitement, and the next night went with
the queen and the princesses to Covent Garden theatre, where
he was received with enthusiasm. The soldiers also acted
admirably and abstained from hurting any one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REPRESSIVE ACTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_315" id="TOPIC_315"></a>The insult to the king and the proceedings of the corresponding
society were met by repressive measures. Proclamations
relating to the outrage and to seditious assemblies were
followed by two bills, one introduced in the lords by Grenville,
the other in the commons by Pitt. The first, the treasonable
practices bill, extended the crime of treason to spoken and
written words not followed by any overt act, and created a new
crime by subjecting to heavy penalties any one convicted of
inciting others to hatred of the sovereign or the established
government. The second, the seditious meetings bill, forbade
all political meetings of which notice had not previously been
given by resident householders, and empowered any two justices
to dissolve a legally constituted meeting at their discretion
by using the riot act. Both these measures were grievous encroachments
on liberty. Apart from its extension of the law
of treason, the first might be used to prevent all discussion of
political reforms; the second checked the public expression of
opinion on public affairs. The ministry, however, was acting in
accordance with the will of parliament and of the vast majority
of the respectable part of the nation, who were alarmed and
indignant at the success of seditious agitators in exciting political
discontent among the uneducated classes. England was
engaged in a struggle for existence, and could not afford to
tolerate sedition. Looking back on issues then incalculable, we
may think that repression was carried farther than was necessary;
but anything was better than the least sign of weakness in dealing
with seditious practices. Excited meetings, over one of
which Fox presided, were held to condemn the bills. Numerous
petitions, mostly got up by the corresponding society, were
presented against them; and many were presented in their
favour. They were violently opposed by the minority in parliament,
and Fox declared that if they became law, obedience
would no longer be a question of duty but of prudence, a direct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
incitement to rebellion only to be excused as uttered in the heat
of debate, an excuse which is also needed for some foolish and
intemperate language on the other side. The sedition bill,
which was limited to three years, was amended by giving up
the clause empowering magistrates to dissolve meetings at their
discretion as dangerous to the public peace. The two bills were
passed in both houses by overwhelming majorities. The treason
act was only to last during the king's life, and both acts proved
quite harmless, for neither was ever called into operation.</p>

<p>Pitt's budget for 1796 included another loan of &pound;18,000,000
and several new taxes, one of them on salt. He proposed
duties on legacies and on collateral successions to real estate.
The first was easily carried, but Fox, in spite of his democratic
professions, seized on the proposal to make landed estates
equally liable with other property to taxation, as an opportunity
for thwarting the government by exciting the selfishness of the
landed gentry, and Pitt found that so many of his supporters
were hostile to the tax that he withdrew his proposal. Nor was
the inequality redressed until 1853, when Gladstone, following
Pitt's lead, made all successions alike liable to duty. As at
the end of the session in May parliament was near the term
of its natural life, a new parliament was elected. The returns
showed that the government had lost no ground in the confidence
of the country: as a rule, the large constituencies elected
supporters of Pitt; indeed, twenty-three of Fox's small following
were returned for nomination boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_316" id="TOPIC_316"></a>The policy of England in 1796 was closely connected with
the course of the war between her Austrian ally and the French.
In March Bonaparte took the command of the army of Italy.
He defeated the Austrians at Montenotte, and compelled the
Sardinian king to abandon the coalition. He crossed the Po,
forced the passage of the Adda at Lodi, and occupied Milan
on May 14. The Austrians fell back behind the Mincio, and
garrisoned the strong fortress of Mantua. Bonaparte levied
contributions on the Dukes of Parma and Modena, forced the
papal states to submission, occupied Leghorn, which was thus
closed against our ships, and reduced the Grand Duke of
Tuscany to obedience. In June Ferdinand of Naples and the
pope made armistices with France. The Austrian power in
Italy depended on the possession of Mantua. Wurmser forced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Bonaparte to raise the siege, and the Austrians though defeated
at Lonato and Castiglione, regarrisoned the place. A second
attempt by Wurmser to relieve it was defeated in August,
and he was shut into Mantua. If Hotham had destroyed the
French fleet in the Mediterranean, Bonaparte would not have
carried everything before him in the Italian states south of
the Po. As it was, his success had an unfortunate effect on
England's naval war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLEET LEAVES THE MEDITERRANEAN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_317" id="TOPIC_317"></a>After 1795 the French made no more attempts to cope with
an English fleet. They employed their navy only in military
expeditions and in the destruction of British commerce.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The
watch upon their ports was slackly kept and ships constantly left
them. Much damage was done to England's trade, specially by
privateers; her navy was largely employed in convoy duty, and
actions between small squadrons and single ships were frequent.
In this year a French squadron cruelly ravaged the coast of Newfoundland,
another captured part of a West India convoy, and a
third made some prizes in the Levant. Warfare of this kind,
though troublesome to England, could not affect her maritime
supremacy. That was impaired by the results of Bonaparte's
campaign in Italy. In December, 1795, the command in the
Mediterranean was taken by Sir John Jervis, a fine seaman and
a strict disciplinarian, who soon brought the fleet to a high state
of efficiency. He kept a strict watch on Toulon, and employed
Nelson in intercepting the French communications by sea. By
the end of June the ports of Tuscany, Naples, and the papal
dominions were shut against his ships; Corsica was restless, and
the fleet was in danger of being left without a base. In July
Nelson, who was then blockading Leghorn, occupied Elba in
order to gain a harbour and establish a place of stores at Porto
Ferrajo. A new danger, however, threatened the fleet, for Spain,
influenced by Bonaparte's successes, made an offensive and defensive
alliance with France by a treaty signed on August 19;
and as the Spaniards had over fifty ships of the line, the position
of the British fleet became critical. And there was work for it
elsewhere, for Portugal was in need of help. The Austrian
cause in Italy seemed almost hopeless, and Jervis received
orders to evacuate the Mediterranean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>Then better news came to England; the Austrians had
achieved a signal success in Germany. Two French armies
under Jourdan and Moreau crossed the Rhine in the summer and
acted independently of each other. After a campaign of about
two months Jourdan was defeated by the Archduke Charles
at Amberg, and again near W&uuml;rzburg on September 3, and was
forced to recross the Rhine. Moreau advanced as far as Munich,
for Bonaparte intended, after the fall of Mantua, which he believed
would not be delayed, to effect a junction with him in Bavaria.
Jourdan's overthrow left Moreau in a critical position, and he
only saved his army by a masterly retreat through the Black
Forest. Bonaparte's hope that he would soon bring the war
to an end by marching into Bavaria, and on Vienna, was disappointed.
His army was kept on the Mincio, for Mantua remained
untaken, and another army under Alvinzi was preparing
to march to its relief. Italy was not conquered yet, and on
October 19 the cabinet decided that the fleet should remain in
the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> It was then too late. Corsica and Elba
were abandoned; Ferdinand of Naples made peace with France,
and Jervis sailed for Lisbon. After three years in the Mediterranean
the fleet retired from its waters; its departure left
that sea closed to British commerce, assured Bonaparte's communications,
and strengthened his hold over Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_318" id="TOPIC_318"></a>Pitt, driven into war against his will, was sincerely anxious
for peace. He had entered on the war for political reasons, and
would not be deterred from negotiation by dislike of the French
republican government. His views were not shared by all his
colleagues; Windham and Pitt's whig supporters generally were
averse from peace because they desired the overthrow of the
revolutionary system. The king fully sympathised with them,
and their sentiments were stimulated and expressed by Burke,
whose first <i>Letter on a Regicide Peace</i> appeared in the autumn.
Pitt believed that the new French government would be willing
to treat, and that it would remain in power, so that a stable peace
might be hoped for. The king's speech at the opening of parliament
in October, 1795, stated that the government would be
willing to treat, and this was emphatically declared in a royal
message to parliament on December 8. Sorely against the king's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
will, an attempt at negotiation was made in the early spring
through Wickham, the British ambassador at Berne. His overtures
were scornfully rejected, the directors replying that no
proposition for the surrender of any of the countries declared by
France to be "re-united" to herself would be entertained. This
was final; for England was bound by treaty to maintain the
integrity of the Austrian dominions, and could treat only on the
basis of the surrender of the Austrian Netherlands by France.</p>

<p>In July the cabinet determined to make another attempt.
A strong party in France desired peace, and the friends and
agents of the British government abroad represented that the
directors would be unable to resist its demands. The expenses
of the war were enormous, for Austria clamoured for financial
support; and it seemed possible that the emperor, pressed by the
double French invasion of Germany and by Bonaparte's victories
in Italy, might make a separate peace.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> England's naval successes
had given her much that Pitt could offer. And he would
offer much, for he was in earnest in his attempt. If it did not
succeed he would at least show the nation that he desired peace,
and the rejection of his offers would wound its pride, rouse its
spirit, and encourage it to bear the burden of the war. George
believed that the attempt would fail, and consented to it because
he reckoned that its failure would have this effect on the nation.
In September the cabinet requested the Danish ambassador
in Paris to ask for a passport for an English minister. The
directors rejected his mediation, but the strength of the peace
party prevented them from declining all negotiation, and they
offered to receive a minister if the British government made
an official request. Great Britain was, in fact, to sue for peace.
The government acquiesced, and Malmesbury was sent over to
Paris. England offered all that she had conquered from France
for a peace which should include her allies, if France would
surrender the Austrian Netherlands either to the emperor or in
exchange for some equivalent which he would accept, and restore
the Milanese. The surrender of the Netherlands was refused,
and on December 19 Malmesbury was ordered to leave Paris in
twenty-four hours. This abrupt termination was connected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the death of Catherine of Russia on November 17, soon after
she had agreed to support Austria with an army of 60,000 men
to be paid by England. Her half-crazy son and successor, Paul,
declared himself neutral. On the part of the directory, however,
the negotiations were illusory, undertaken merely to appease
domestic discontent. The French declared that England's offers
were insincere. Fox and his party adopted the same line, and
their attacks on the government left them with thirty-seven
supporters in the commons and eight in the lords.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_319" id="TOPIC_319"></a>This ineffectual negotiation roughly coincides with the beginning
of an awful period of stress and depression. The
directory designed to isolate England, reduce her to bankruptcy
by destroying her commerce, and complete her ruin by invasion.
Already Austria, her one efficient ally, was nearly exhausted;
her commerce was shut out from the Mediterranean,
and, though vigorously pushed in other quarters, was constantly
harassed, and a plan of invasion was ripe for prosecution. Pitt
met the prospect of invasion by proposals for increasing the
army and navy by parochial levies, and for the formation of
militia reserves and irregular cavalry. Fox asserted that the
French did not contemplate an invasion, and that the immediate
duty of parliament was to guard the freedom of the people against
its domestic enemies, the ministers. This disgraceful speech
roused the indignation of the peace-loving Wilberforce, who
declared that Fox and his friends seemed to wish that just so
much evil should befall their country as would bring them into
office. Though the government easily carried its proposals for
defence, it was embarrassed by financial difficulties. Pitt had
granted an advance of &pound;1,200,000 to the emperor without the
consent of parliament. He was justly blamed for this unconstitutional
act, and eighty-one members voted against the
government. In his budget of December 7 he proposed another
loan of &pound;18,000,000. The public debt already exceeded
&pound;400,000,000; the 3 per cents. had fallen with its growth, and
in September were at 53. In the dangerous position of the
country, financiers would have declined the loan, and Pitt offered
it to the public at 5 per cent. and &pound;112 10s. stock for &pound;100
money. Liberal as these terms may seem, they were exiguous
at that critical time, and the stock was at 4 per cent. discount
before the deposit was paid. Pitt, however, appealed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
loyalty of the country. Patriotic enthusiasm was aroused, and
the "loyalty loan" was promptly subscribed. Twenty-nine new
items of taxation were imposed during the session; one of them
raised the stamp duty on newspapers, which Pitt described as a
luxury, from 2d. to 3&frac12;d., and was calculated to produce &pound;114,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RELIGIOUS FEUD IN IRELAND.</i></div>

<p>The threats of invasion were not vain; a descent on Ireland
was attempted. The government, though withholding emancipation,
had made an effort to conciliate the catholics. While
the penal code was in force Irish priests were educated abroad.
Burke held that they required a special education, and that
seminaries should be established for them in Ireland as a means
of keeping them from disloyalty. The destruction of the French
seminaries by the republicans left no choice between a priesthood
educated at home and one without education, and therefore
likely to be dangerous to civil order. Camden met the
difficulty by favouring the foundation of the college of Maynooth.
Religious animosity had broken out afresh since the
recall of Fitzwilliam, and many outrages were committed on
both sides. On September 1, 1795, the defenders and peep-of-day
boys fought near a village called Diamond, in Armagh, and
the defenders were worsted with some slaughter. Immediately
afterwards the Orange society was founded to maintain the
protestant cause. In 1796 protestant mobs assuming the name
of Orangemen, persecuted the catholics in Armagh, and drove
them from their homes, bidding them go "to hell or Connaught".
The magistrates gave the catholics little help, and
the government minimised the outrages of the protestants.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_320" id="TOPIC_320"></a>Religious hatred changed the position of parties. The United
Irishmen no longer attempted to unite men of the two religions;
they encouraged the catholics to believe that the protestants
were determined to destroy them and conquer the land for
themselves. There was much anarchy. Catholic disloyalty was
increased by the feeling that the government favoured the
Orangemen, and attacks were made on royal troops in Connaught.
A stringent insurrection act was passed, which gave
the magistrates power to send on board the fleet those attending
unlawful assemblies or otherwise acting disloyally, and in
the autumn the <i>habeas corpus</i> act was suspended. Corps of
yeomanry and infantry were formed by the gentry for their
own protection, and were accepted by the crown. The defenders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
coalesced with the United Irishmen, and the society adopted a
military organisation. On different pretexts, such as a potato-digging,
funerals, or football matches, large bodies of men assembled
in military array; guns were collected, and pike-heads
forged. Leading members of the United Irishmen pressed the
directory to send an expedition to Ireland, representing that
the catholic peasantry and the dissenters of Ulster were alike
ripe for revolt. Among the most active of these agents were
Wolfe Tone, Arthur O'Connor, and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, a
son of the Duke of Leinster, a young man of romantic disposition
and no special abilities, who had married a lady of
great beauty, well known in French society, Pamela, supposed to
be a daughter of Madame de Genlis by the Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_321" id="TOPIC_321"></a>The directors appointed Hoche to command an invading
force, and a fleet of seventeen ships of the line, thirteen frigates,
and other vessels sailed from Brest on December 15 with 15,000
troops and a supply of arms for distribution. Though an invasion
was expected, the fleet met with no enemy, and evaded a
squadron which was on the look-out off Ushant. Some of the
ships, however, were separated from the others, and one of
seventy-four guns was wrecked through the incapacity of the
French naval officers. On the 21st thirty-five ships of the fleet
arrived at the mouth of Bantry bay, "in most delicious weather,"
wrote Tone, who accompanied the expedition. Then the wind
changed and blew hard. Only fifteen ships managed to enter
the bay, and five of them were forced by the gale to put out to
sea again. The ship on which Hoche sailed did not arrive. No
landing was effected, and, on January 17, the battered fleet returned
to Brest, less five ships lost, six captured by some
British ships lying at Cork, and one of seventy-four guns, which
was attacked on its way home by two English frigates off
Ushant, driven ashore, and wrecked.</p>

<p>If the wind had remained light and favourable, or if the
French had been better seamen, and their force had landed,
Ireland would probably have been conquered for a time, for the
country was drained of regular troops. Between Bantry and
Cork were only 4,000 men hastily collected at Bandon, and
stores and artillery were virtually non-existent. That a French
fleet should have been able to leave Brest, remain five days
on the Irish coast, and return without being attacked by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
channel fleet caused great alarm in England, and was due to
Bridport's slackness. The Irish of all classes behaved with
exemplary loyalty; the country people afforded every assistance
in their power to the troops at Bandon, and no symptom of disaffection
appeared in Dublin. It was evident that many who
had joined the disloyal societies had been driven to do so by
fear, and that the catholics as a body were not as yet ready
to revolt.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Either merely to harass England, or to prove the
feasibility of a more serious invasion, two frigates and two other
vessels were despatched from Brest in February with about
1,200 men, half of them convicts. After destroying some merchantmen
in the Bristol channel, they anchored in Fishguard
bay. The troops landed on the 23rd, and were, it is said, much
alarmed through mistaking a body of Welshwomen in their red
cloaks and beaver hats for soldiers. The next day Lord Cawdor,
captain of the Pembrokeshire yeomanry, appeared with a
force of local troops and country folk, and they at once surrendered.
The two frigates which brought them were captured
on their way back to Brest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SUSPENSION OF CASH PAYMENTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_322" id="TOPIC_322"></a>The expenses of the war, loans and subsidies to foreign
princes, and bills drawn by British agents abroad caused a continual
drain of specie from the bank of England. By 1795 the
exchange became unfavourable, and since then the drain had
been enormous. Pitt anticipated taxes and borrowed heavily.
Believing that an invasion was imminent, many small tradesmen
and others were eager to turn their property into cash; a run
on country banks set in, and some failed. The bank of England
was pressed for gold. On Saturday, February 25, the floating
debt owed to it by government was about &pound;7,500,000, and its
stock of coin and bullion, which in 1794 was over &pound;8,500,000,
was reduced to &pound;1,272,000; and a sharp run was expected on
Monday. The bank itself, and the private banks which depended
on it, were threatened with immediate stoppage, and the consequences
to the country would have been disastrous. The directors
applied to Pitt. He called the king to London; a privy council
was held on Sunday, and an order was issued suspending cash
payments at the bank until the will of parliament was expressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
The leading merchants and bankers at once declared that they
would accept bank of England notes.</p>

<p>Committees of both houses of parliament reported that the
bank was in a thoroughly stable condition, and, after much
debating, during which Fox asserted that Pitt deserved impeachment
for defrauding the public creditor, a bill was passed on
May 3 prohibiting the bank from issuing cash, except in sums
below &pound;1, until six months after the end of the war. Cash
payments were not resumed until 1819. A fair, though constantly
decreasing amount of gold remained in circulation for
some years, and was supplemented by the issue of one pound
notes. The bank was moderate in its issues, and, except in 1800,
there was no appreciable difference between the value of its paper
and gold until 1808. The government was undoubtedly justified
in saving the bank from the effects of panic. Whether the suspension
should have been continued after the restoration of
public confidence is another matter. It was continued chiefly
because it enabled the bank to make large advances to government
without incurring a drain of bullion. Currency was at
once expanded, and Pitt obtained a new loan of &pound;14,500,000;
it was raised mainly in the 3 per cents., and created a debt of
&pound;175 for each &pound;100 cash. Pitt therefore paid, including the
provision for long annuity, at the rate of &pound;6 7s. per cent. The
imperial loan of &pound;1,620,000 was raised on even more onerous
terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF CAPE ST. VINCENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_323" id="TOPIC_323"></a>In the midst of anxiety and financial depression England
was cheered by a great naval victory. France called on Spain
to form a junction of fleets. It was the old idea of 1779 when
the two Bourbon powers were to destroy the channel fleet and
lay England open to invasion. The Spanish fleet, twenty-seven
ships of the line, under Admiral de C&oacute;rdova, sailed from Carthagena
for Cadiz on February 1. Jervis was then cruising off
Cape St. Vincent, and before dawn on the 14th he received
tidings that the Spaniards were near. He had only fifteen ships
of the line, but his squadron was in splendid order, and among
its commanders were Commodore Nelson and Captains Collingwood,
Troubridge, and Saumarez. The Spaniards were eager
to get to port, and ten of their ships were far ahead of the rest
on the leeward side. He made for the gap and attacked the
main body of seventeen ships, keeping the nine lee ships (one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
had got away) in check meanwhile. After some cannonading
and man&oelig;uvring the Spaniards attempted to join their lee
division. They were stopped by Nelson who, on his own responsibility,
wore his ship, the <i>Captain</i> (74), took her out of
the line, crossed the bows of five Spaniards, and promptly
supported by Troubridge in the <i>Culloden</i> (74), engaged the
gigantic Spanish flagship, the <i>Santisima Trinidad</i> (130), and
two others. His daring man&oelig;uvre threw the enemy into confusion
and enabled the British to come to close quarters.</p>

<p>During the fight the <i>Captain</i> was crippled, "her wheel and
foretopmast gone and not a sail or rope left". She was engaged
by several of the enemy, particularly by the <i>San Nicolas</i> (80)
and the <i>San Josef</i> (112), whose mizzen-mast she had shot away.
Collingwood pushed his ship, the <i>Excellent</i> (74), between her
and the <i>San Nicolas</i>, gave the Spaniard a broadside within pistol
shot, and passed on. The <i>San Nicolas</i> "luffing and the <i>San
Josef's</i> mizzen-mast being gone, they fell on board of each
other". Nelson boarded the <i>San Nicolas</i> and captured her.
From her he and his men boarded the <i>San Josef</i>, which also
surrendered, and on her deck he received the swords of the
Spanish officers. Four of the enemy's ships were taken and
the <i>Santisima Trinidad</i> surrendered but was not secured.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
The fight lasted until evening, and though the Spaniards had
ten ships which had not been closely engaged and eight more
uncrippled, they drew off in the night. They showed an utter
lack of seamanship in the action. The number of their fleet,
the size and quality of their ships, and the weight of metal they
carried place this battle of St. Valentine's Day, or Cape St.
Vincent, among the splendid victories of the British navy. Its
moral effect was excellent; it helped the nation to pass through
the banking crisis with calmness, and raised its spirits. The
long-standing belief that Spain was a first-rate maritime power
was destroyed at last. Jervis was created Earl of St. Vincent
and received a pension of &pound;3,000 a year, and Nelson, already
gazetted rear-admiral, a pension of &pound;1,000 and the order of the
Bath. About the same time Admiral Harvey, commanding
in the Leeward islands, and Sir Ralph Abercromby captured
Trinidad from the Spaniards, but failed in an attack on Puerto-rico.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_324" id="TOPIC_324"></a>It was well that England should be encouraged, for darker
days were at hand. The Austrian attempt in Italy in the
autumn of 1796 ended in disaster. Although Alvinzi beat the
French at Caldiero on November 12, he was no match for
Bonaparte in generalship, and the Austrians were defeated in a
three days' battle at Arcola on the 15th-17th. A last attempt
to save Mantua was foiled by Bonaparte's victory at Rivoli on
January 14, and on February 2 the great fortress was surrendered
by Wurmser. Bonaparte led his victorious army into Carinthia,
overcame the Austrian resistance with the help of Mass&eacute;na and
Joubert, and advanced to Leoben about 100 miles from Vienna.
The death of Catherine had deprived the emperor of his hopes
of help from Russia, and on April 18 preliminaries of peace
were signed at Leoben. Francis renounced his rights over the
Netherlands and agreed to a congress for the conclusion of a
peace with the empire. By secret articles he promised to surrender
his territories west of the Oglio and to accept in exchange
the <i>terra firma</i> of Venice from the Oglio eastward, with Venetian
Dalmatia and Istria. Lombardy and the rest of the Venetian
<i>terra firma</i> were to be constituted an independent republic by
France, and Venice was to be indemnified by the Legations,
Romagna, Ferrara, and Bologna. The emperor negotiated apart
from Great Britain and without sending any notice of his intentions
to London,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and England suddenly found herself deprived
of her one efficient ally.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISCONTENT IN THE NAVY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_325" id="TOPIC_325"></a>Her enemies were preparing to close in upon her. Three
fleets threatened her with invasion. A French fleet lay at
Brest, inadequately watched by Bridport; a Spanish fleet at
Cadiz was closely blockaded by Jervis; and Duncan with the
North sea fleet kept watch for a fleet which the Dutch at the
bidding of France were fitting out in the Texel. The safety
of the realm depended on the navy, and the navy mutinied.
Both soldiers and sailors had just grievances, specially as regards
their pay. Seditious pamphlets were distributed among
the soldiers by the democratic societies, and, it was believed,
among the sailors also.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The discontent in the army, which
for a time appeared likely to have serious consequences, was
allayed through the influence of the Duke of York. The pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
of privates of the line was raised from 8&frac14;d. to 1s. a day, though
a deduction on account of the existing high price of provisions
reduced the actual increase to 2d.; and other advantages were
granted.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The sailors had no royal duke to speak for them. Mutinies
had broken out sporadically in the navy during the American
war and temporary concessions had been made, but there was
no general removal of grievances. The pay remained as it was
fixed in the reign of Charles II. at 22s. 6d. a month (of twenty-eight
days) for able seamen and 19s. for ordinary seamen, though
the cost of living had risen, the men said, 30 per cent., so that
they could not provide for their families. The system on which
they were paid was unfair to them; a deduction of two ounces in
the pound was made in their rations by the admiralty to balance
waste of stores; the medical service was disgracefully bad, and
they complained bitterly of the shameful practice of not providing
them with fresh vegetables as a protection from scurvy
when in English ports. Punishments were sometimes frightfully
severe and a tyrannical captain could make a ship a floating
hell. A mutiny, only remotely connected with the general
movement, was provoked on the <i>Hermione</i> (32) on the Jamaica
station by the insane cruelty of Pigot, the captain; the crew
murdered him and the other officers, and delivered the ship to
the Spaniards from whom it was afterwards retaken. Owing
to the large demand for men in war time many crews contained
a large number of bad characters, criminals whose sentences
were remitted on condition of entering the navy, and such like,
and on some ships there were many Irishmen who had imbibed
disaffection on shore. Such men would naturally be inclined to
mutiny. A ship's crew, however, took its tone from the able
seamen, the A.B.'s, from whom the petty officers were chosen.
At that time they were often not more than a fourth of the
crew, and unfortunately they had special grievances. They were
skilled men, and might have been mates with good pay on a
merchant ship. They were forced to serve in the navy by
impressment, and when in port were refused leave to visit their
families for fear they should desert. In the winter of 1796-97
the able seamen in the channel fleet seem to have combined to
obtain a redress of grievances. Anonymous petitions were sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
to Lord Howe, who forwarded them to the admiralty where
they were disregarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MUTINY IN THE NAVY.</i></div>

<p>On April 15 the fleet, which was then at Spithead, was
ordered to put to sea. The crews instead of weighing anchor
manned the yards, cheered, and hoisted the red flag, the usual
signal for battle. They were joined by the marines. No personal
disrespect was shown to the officers, but the ships were
taken out of their command. The admiralty board went down
to Portsmouth and held an interview with the delegates from
the ships, who presented a list of their demands. The commissioners
haggled; the men stood firm, and further demanded
that officers accused of tyranny should be dismissed their ships.
On the 25th the commissioners gave way on all points; the
pay of able seamen was to be the same as that of privates in
the army, though without deductions, 1s. a day, or a rise of
5s. 6d. a month; ordinary seamen were to receive a rise of
4s. 6d.; their other grievances were to be redressed; and a promise
was given that the fleet should not be sent to sea until
the increase of pay had been voted by the house of commons,
and the king's pardon had been proclaimed. Various hindrances,
which might perhaps have been overcome if the government
had appreciated the need of promptitude, delayed the application
to parliament. Days passed by; the sailors heard nothing of a
bill for the rise in their wages or of a proclamation of pardon,
and an ill-judged order sent by the admiralty to the captains
with reference to stores and to mutinous conduct roused their
suspicions. They believed that they had been cajoled. Hitherto
their conduct had been as blameless as the nature of the case
allowed. It was so no longer. Two of the ships remained at
Spithead; the rest had gone to St. Helen's. On May 7 all the
crews again mutinied and most of the officers were sent ashore.
A struggle took place on board the <i>London</i>; a mutineer was
shot dead, and a midshipman and a marine officer were wounded.
Pitt proposed a grant for the increase of pay on the 8th, and, as
discussion might be mischievous, asked for a silent vote. To
their shame, Fox and his friends used this crisis as an opportunity
for a violent party attack on the government.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The
money was voted, and on the 10th Howe, the sailors' favourite
"Black Dick," went down to the fleet with the vote and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
king's proclamation. The men were pacified; more than 100
officers to whom they objected were removed from the ships;
discipline was restored, and the fleet put to sea.</p>

<p>The admiralty commissioners, after contesting the just demands
of the men, had yielded to a dangerous point by removing
officers at the dictation of mutineers. Their vacillation
encouraged the idea that mutiny paid, and mutiny accordingly
spread. On the 12th it broke out in the ships lying at the
Little Nore with reinforcements for the North sea fleet. These
ships contained a large number of London roughs and some
disaffected Irishmen. Unlike the mutiny at Spithead, it was a
violent and criminal movement. It was directed by Richard
Parker, a seaman of some education on board the <i>Sandwich</i>
(90), who is said to have entered the navy as a midshipman,
to have been dismissed his ship for immorality, and as mate
to have been broken for insubordination; he had been imprisoned
for debt at Perth, and had volunteered for the navy in
order to obtain his release. Delegates were chosen; the red flag
was hoisted, and the officers were deprived of command. From
the first an element of weakness existed in the movement, for
the men were not unanimous; two loyal frigates were forced to
join the mutiny, and there was a loyal minority on the others.
The squadron moved out to the Great Nore, and the mutineers
paraded Sheerness with a red flag. Lord Spencer and his colleagues
went down to Sheerness and had an interview with the
delegates; they failed to persuade them to return to their duty,
and Parker treated them with insolence. Besides the demands
made by the channel fleet, which were already granted, the
mutineers required that no officer that had been removed from
his ship should again be employed in her without the consent of
the ship's company, and that the articles of war should be revised.
Demands of that kind, of course, could not be discussed.
The first sign of weakness in the movement appeared on the
29th; the two loyal frigates left the squadron and, though fired
on by the rest, made good their escape. The mutineers, however,
soon received an accession of strength which encouraged
them to proceed to further acts of rebellion.</p>

<p>The mutiny spread to Duncan's fleet then in Yarmouth Roads.
The men knew that the Dutch fleet was preparing for an invasion
of the kingdom, and they left the way open. All the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
ships, save Duncan's flagship and one other, deserted him and
joined the mutineers at the Nore. Nevertheless, the stouthearted
admiral sailed with his two ships to his station off the
Texel, determined if the Dutch came out to fight them. While
there he concealed his weakness from the enemy by making
signals as though his fleet lay in the offing. England was in
imminent danger, and Count Vorontsov (Woronzow), the tsar's
ambassador, directed the Russian squadron, then at Yarmouth
and under orders for home, to delay its departure and join
Duncan until he could be reinforced from Spithead, the greatest
service, wrote Grenville, that England has ever received from
any nation.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Happily, the Dutch fleet was not ready to put to
sea. The mutinous crews attempted to intimidate the government
by blockading the Thames, and trading vessels were
stopped at the entrance of the river. Some officers were ill-treated.
Farmhouses on the coast were sacked. The country
was greatly alarmed, and the 3 per cents. fell to a trifle over 48.
The government acted with vigour; the garrison at Sheerness
was strongly reinforced; furnaces for heating shot were made
ready in the forts on the Thames; gunboats were fitted out, and
the buoys at the mouth of the river were taken up to prevent the
escape of the mutineers. In response to a royal message, parliament
passed bills on June 3 and 6 providing that incitement to
mutiny should be punishable with the highest penalties of misdemeanour,
and that intercourse with the mutinous ships should
be a capital felony.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAVAL DISCIPLINE RESTORED.</i></div>

<p>The mutineers "ordered" captain Lord Northesk, who
was virtually imprisoned on his ship, to go to London and lay
their demands before the king. An official answer was returned
requiring unconditional surrender. They grew uneasy, and their
doubts of success were increased by addresses sent from the
seamen of the channel fleet, severely reprobating their conduct.
Cut off from communication with the shore and without hope
of support from the channel fleet, they soon lost heart altogether.
Parker became unpopular. Ship after ship either left
the squadron or signalled a return to obedience, and finally,
on the 14th, the crew of the <i>Sandwich</i> brought her under the
battery at Sheerness, and surrendered Parker. He was tried
by a court-martial, and hanged at the yard-arm of his ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
About forty were condemned to death, and some others were
flogged. The government was inclined to mercy, for the bulk
of the men had been deluded by Parker and other scoundrels;
only fourteen seamen and four marines were executed; the other
condemned men were pardoned by the king after the next great
naval victory.</p>

<p>A mutinous spirit appeared in other divisions of the navy.
The squadron at the Cape was brought to order by Lord
Macartney, the governor, who threatened to sink the ship most
forward in the movement by bombarding her from the shore.
One of the ships off Cadiz began a mutiny; St. Vincent, a
rigid disciplinarian, though, as the men knew, careful for their
welfare, was equal to the occasion; the ringleader was sentenced
by a court-martial, and St. Vincent surrounded the ship with
gunboats, and forced the crew to hang him themselves, and
that on a Sunday morning, which, being against all precedent,
deeply impressed the sailors. Convinced that the idleness attending
a long blockade was bad for discipline, he kept his
ships employed as much as possible, and, in July, detached a
squadron under Nelson to attack Santa Cruz. The attack was
unsuccessful, and cost Nelson his right arm. England never
passed through darker days than those of the mutinies.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The
lessons they teach are that a country which neglects the legitimate
grievances of its defenders pursues a course not less
perilous than shabby; and that mutinous conduct of every kind
should at once be met with exemplary severity. Neither impressment
nor flogging was included in the seamen's grievances,
but they complained of unjust treatment by officers. Since
1797 their condition steadily though slowly improved, and they
were treated both by their officers and the admiralty with more
of the consideration to which their splendid services entitled
them. To Nelson the health and contentment of his seamen
were always matters of care and pride.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEGOTIATIONS AT LILLE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_326" id="TOPIC_326"></a>Pitt, seeing England destitute of efficient allies, threatened
with invasion, short of money, burdened with debt and taxation,
with public credit at a low ebb, and with her fleets in
mutiny, was set on peace, if it could be had on reasonable
terms. He was encouraged by the state of parties in France,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
for in May the moderates or royalists who desired to put an
end to the war gained a majority in the legislative councils. On
June 1 the government proposed a negotiation for preliminaries
of a peace which should be definitely arranged at a future congress.
The proposal was rejected by the directors, who would
not allow any concert between Great Britain and Austria, or
any discussion of the general interests of Europe, and insisted
that England should negotiate for a definite and separate peace.
Grenville considered that this would be humiliating to England,
and would have resigned rather than consent to it if he
had not felt it his duty not to embarrass the government.
The king heartily agreed with him, and so did Lord Liverpool
(Hawkesbury) and Windham.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Pitt was too strong for them,
and Malmesbury was sent to meet the French commissioners
at Lille. He had scarcely arrived there when Burke, who by
voice and pen had so long warned England to have no peace
with France, died on July 9. Here, wrote Canning, "there is
but one event, but that is an event for the world&mdash;Burke is
dead". One of the five French directors was a constitutional
royalist, another, Carnot, was inclined to that side, the other
three were jacobins. A struggle was impending between this
jacobin triumvirate and the majority in the councils. The success
of Malmesbury's mission depended on its issue. England's need
of peace may be gauged by Pitt's offers of the recognition of
the French sovereignty over Belgium, Luxemburg, Savoy, and
Nice, of the cession of all her conquests from France, Spain, and
Holland, except Trinidad and the Cape, and of an exchange
for Ceylon. In the discussions of the cabinet Grenville opposed
Pitt's pacific policy, and as he found that the contents of
Malmesbury's despatches became known out of doors, and that
Pitt was enabled to support his opinions by the opinions of
others, he arranged that Malmesbury's specially secret communications
should be withheld from his colleagues generally,
and they were only seen by himself, Pitt, and Canning,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> the
under-secretary for foreign affairs. Difficulties were raised by
the French as to the royal style "King of Great Britain and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
France," the restitution of, or an equivalent for, the ships taken
or destroyed at Toulon, and the retention of any conquests
from the Dutch.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_327" id="TOPIC_327"></a>The negotiations were prolonged, for Malmesbury hoped
that the majority in the councils would prove stronger than
the triumvirate, and the triumvirs would not break them off
before they had secured their position. During their progress
Portugal, England's sole remaining ally, made a separate peace.
A <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> was effected by the army on September 4 (18th
Fructidor); the royalist and moderate deputies were condemned
to transportation, two new directors were chosen, and the jacobin,
or war party, was established in power. New commissioners
were sent to Lille, and on the 14th Malmesbury was asked if
he would agree to the restitution of every conquest made from
France and her allies. He replied that that was beyond his
powers, and was ordered to depart in twenty-four hours. After
this abrupt termination of Malmesbury's mission the former
friendly and confidential relations between Pitt and Grenville
were fully restored. The <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> baffled Pitt's efforts. It
was followed by the conclusion of a definite peace between France
and the emperor, which destroyed all hope of a concert between
Great Britain and Austria. After the preliminaries of Leoben,
Bonaparte declared war on Venice, procured the overthrow of
its ancient constitution, and established a new municipality. By
the treaty of Campo Formio, concluded October 17, he betrayed
the Venetians by handing over their city to Austria, along with
Istria, Dalmatia, and the Venetian <i>terra firma</i> as far west as
the Adige, while France took the Ionian islands for herself.
The emperor resigned the Belgic provinces, and by a secret
article promised to use his influence in the empire to secure
to France the left bank of the Rhine. The directors looked
forward to an invasion of England. While her navy was engaged
with the fleets of Spain and Holland, a French force was
to cross the channel and march on London; Ireland would
revolt; England would accept a democracy, and Tip&uacute; would
destroy her power in India.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The futility of their arrogant hopes was already exhibited.
Another invasion of Ireland was planned in the spring. A
Dutch fleet was to carry over a land force, and was to be fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>lowed
by Hoche and the Brest fleet. The United Irishmen
eagerly expected a French invasion. Though the Dutch fleet
was not ready until the crisis of the mutinies was over, Duncan's
force was still small. Week after week the wind prevented
the Dutch from leaving the Texel. Provisions ran short, and
Duncan's fleet was again in force. The great opportunity had
passed by. Fresh plans were made for descents on Ireland and
Scotland in concert with a French expedition; but the hopes of
the United Irishmen received a further blow in the death of
Hoche. At last, on October 6, the Dutch fleet left the Texel.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_328" id="TOPIC_328"></a>Duncan received the news at Yarmouth on the 9th, and on
the 11th came up with the enemy off Camperdown. In number
of ships the fleets were about equal, but the British were the
stronger. Duncan attacked in two divisions, broke through the
Dutch line in two places and engaged to leeward, cutting them
off from their coast. He signalled for each ship to engage its
opponent, as in Howe's action of the First of June. Mistakes
led to a concentration of force on the Dutch rear, which had
good results.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The Dutch fought with splendid courage, and
the carnage on both sides was terrible. Nine Dutch ships,
including the <i>Vrijheid</i> (74), the flagship of their admiral, De
Winter, were taken. The shattered remainder of their fleet put
back into the Texel. The British admiral was created Viscount
Duncan of Camperdown, and received a pension of &pound;3,000 a
year. The victory was of incalculable importance. Three
fleets threatened the kingdom, and Camperdown, as Grenville
said, broke the right wing of the invasion.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> It raised the
spirits of the nation. Won by the fleet so lately in mutiny, it
proved that England could again, as of old, rely on the loyalty
of her navy. It reasserted her supremacy at sea, which, in spite
of the victories of Howe and Jervis, seemed weakened by the
evacuation of the Mediterranean and the mutinies. Supreme at
sea, she carried the trade of the world. Since the great drop of
1793 her commerce had increased year by year until it again
declined in 1797. From that year, fostered by the demands of
war and fed by the activity of British manufactures, it increased
with extraordinary rapidity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SECESSION FROM PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_329" id="TOPIC_329"></a>In parliament the opposition gained no ground. On May
26, Grey again brought forward the question of reform, and this
time propounded a scheme. He proposed that the counties
should return 113 instead of 92 members, that they should be
divided into districts each with one member, and that the franchise
should be extended to leaseholders and copyholders, that
in boroughs householders only should have votes, that polls should
be held simultaneously, and that, if possible, no one should record
more than one vote; that all landowners, traders, and
"professors of science" should be qualified for a seat, and that
parliaments should be triennial. Pitt declared that the country
did not desire reform, and the motion was lost by 252 to 91.
When parliament met in November, Fox and some of his chief
supporters in both houses seceded, attending only on special
occasions. Their conduct was unconstitutional and ill-advised.
It is the duty of a member of parliament to attend its proceedings,
and in the commons his attendance can be enforced.
Secession is a betrayal of a public trust and a declaration against
the constitution. In this case it was partial, and therefore specially
futile. It caused a division among the little band of the
opposition, and injured the seceders in the opinion of the
country; their conduct was considered unpatriotic, and Fox's
absence from parliament when the thanks of the house were
voted to Duncan was particularly blamed. The secession of
their leaders gave some whigs of less standing an opportunity
of coming to the front. In Fox's absence the remnant of the
opposition was led by Tierney, a clever financier and a brilliant
speaker with a bitter tongue. From the beginning of the war
constant motions had been made for peace with France. They
were discontinued after 1797; for it was generally recognised
that Pitt would gladly welcome peace. Wit came to the support
of the government; Gillray bitterly caricatured Fox and the
opposition, and in November the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> began its brilliant
mockery of democratic principles and politics. Its most telling
verses were the work of Canning, who entered the ministry as
under-secretary for foreign affairs in January, 1796. The threats
of invasion roused the spirit of the country. Danger was no
longer to be apprehended from English disloyalty; the nation
was justly proud of the achievements of its navy and was full of
loyalty and courage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_330" id="TOPIC_330"></a>Pitt took advantage of this spirit. Parliament met on November
3, and he brought in his budget on the 24th. All hope
of a speedy termination of the war ended with the rupture of
the negotiations at Lille. He therefore declared that though it
was impossible to raise the whole of the supplies in the year,
it was the duty of the nation to contribute its full share towards
the expenses of the war in order that posterity might not be
burdened with an unfair accumulation of debt. The service of the
year amounted to &pound;25,500,000, and a deficiency of &pound;19,000,000
had to be supplied. He proposed to borrow &pound;12,000,000 and
to raise &pound;7,000,000 by taxation, chiefly by a measure generally
known as trebling the assessed taxes, by which the amounts
already charged in respect of these taxes were augmented on a
scale graduated according to income. Praiseworthy as his effort
was to keep down debt, his plan was open to serious objection.
Assessed taxes are essentially an optional expense, in that they
can be avoided by those who do not choose to incur them.
Pitt's plan made the payments of the preceding year an arbitrary
standard of taxation, increasing them by one quarter to
treble and progressively to quadruple their amounts. This was
really an income tax in disguise, with the special drawback that
it forced those who reduced their style of living to pay on the
basis of their former expenditure. Fox returned to parliament
to oppose the bill, and in one division the minority numbered
75. Some feeling was excited against Pitt out of doors. When,
on December 19, the king and queen went in state to St. Paul's
to return thanks for the three great naval victories won by
Howe over the French, St. Vincent over the Spaniards, and
Duncan over the Dutch, Pitt was hooted by the London mob,
and as he returned home was guarded by a party of horse.
This outbreak of ill-temper was of no important significance.
The nation was fully determined to support the government in
its efforts to maintain the safety and honour of England.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>IRISH REBELLION AND NAVAL SUPREMACY.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_331" id="TOPIC_331"></a>In spite of Duncan's victory the French directors were set on an
invasion of England. All their vague designs for the extension
of French supremacy led up to the ruin of the power which they
recognised as their most formidable enemy. From the Adriatic
to the North sea a vast republic was to furnish the armies of
France with recruits. Europe was to be united in a coalition
against England. The Mediterranean was to be a French lake.
Every port was to be shut against England's ships; England's
commerce was to be destroyed and her pride humbled. A
quicker means of bringing her into subjection seemed possible.
On a foggy night an army might be carried across the Channel
unobserved by her fleet. What a Norman duke had done might
be done by a mighty republic, and the English crown might be
lost in a second battle of Hastings. The victors would march
on London, and be received as deliverers by a people groaning
under the oppression of "that monster Pitt". They failed to
understand that Pitt had the nation at his back, and that even
the most violent whigs would resist to the death an invasion of
their country. They formed an "army of England," and appointed
Bonaparte to command it. On his return to Paris in
December, 1797, he set himself to prepare for the invasion.
Transports for over 24,000 men were soon ready at Boulogne,
Ambleteuse, Calais, and Dunkirk, and boat-builders were hard
at work. In February he made a tour of the coast from Etaples
to Ostend and heard what sailors said about the scheme. On the
23rd he told the directors that France could not gain supremacy
by sea for some years, and that without that no operation could
be more hazardous than an invasion of England, that a surprise
was possible only in the long winter nights, and that their naval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
preparations were too backward for such an attempt to be made
that year.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> He turned to other projects of conquest which might
lead to the destruction of England's commerce in the east and of
her power in India. For some while longer he ostensibly devoted
himself to preparations for invasion. The "army of England,"
which in April numbered 56,000 men, was quartered in the
towns of the north, and every port from Havre to the Texel
was crowded with transports. But by that time the army had lost
its commander and the great scheme was definitely abandoned.
Nevertheless, the directors determined to be ready if an opportunity
for invasion should occur, and maritime preparations were
continued. In May a flotilla from Havre attacked the islands of
St. Marcouf, which had been seized by Sir Sidney Smith in 1795,
and was beaten back by the little garrison. Equally feeble efforts
were made by England to check the preparations for invasion.
On tidings that the transports built at Flushing were to be conveyed
to Ostend by canal in order to avoid the British fleet, a
force of 1,200 men was sent to destroy the sluices of the Bruges
canal. They landed near Ostend and blew up the great sluice.
A storm prevented them from re-embarking and, after a smart
engagement, they were all taken prisoners. If the thing was
worth doing, a sufficient force should have been sent to do it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INVASION THREATENED.</i></div>

<p>The threatened invasion rallied the nation to the support
of the government. Though Fox and the other seceders had
ceased to attend parliament, they kept up an agitation against
the ministry. Fox's birthday, January 24, was celebrated by a
public dinner. The Duke of Norfolk in proposing his health
said that Washington began the war of independence with only
2,000 men, yet America was free; he saw that number before
him, let them apply his words. He afterwards called on the
company to drink "our sovereign's health, the majesty of the
people". Considered in connexion with the circumstances of
the time his words were in the highest degree seditious. The
government, strong in the support of the nation, took up the
silly and insolent challenge, and the duke was deprived of his
lord-lieutenancy and the command of his militia regiment. In
May, Fox repeated the toast at a meeting of the whig club.
The ministers discussed what notice should be taken of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
offence. It is not pleasant to find Pitt considering whether he
might be led on to utter similar words in parliament and be sent
to the Tower for the rest of the session. With all his greatness
Pitt lacked the generosity which was a redeeming trait in Fox's
character. The anxieties of the past year, combined with his
unfortunate failing, had shaken his health and his temper had
suffered. It was finally decided that Fox should be removed
from the privy council, and the king struck his name out of the
council book with his own hand.</p>

<p>The belief that the country was in danger evoked patriotic
enthusiasm, and &pound;2,300,000 was subscribed to augment the produce
of the triple assessment. Pitt's supplementary budget
announced a further loan of &pound;3,000,000 and imposed fresh
taxes. Chiefly as a means of supporting credit he brought
forward a scheme for the commutation of the land tax. For
many years the tax had been granted at four shillings in the
pound; he proposed to make it perpetual at that rate, to enable
landowners to redeem it, and to apply their payments to the
reduction of debt. The bill, though opposed in both houses on
the plea that it was unfair to the landed interest, was carried by
large majorities. The alien act and the suspension of <i>habeas
corpus</i> were revived, for with the enemy threatening the country
disloyalty was intolerable. With a view to the organisation of
defence the government was empowered to ascertain the number
of men who were prepared to take up arms in case of invasion,
to instruct each as to what he should do, and to arrange for the
removal of helpless persons, cattle, and other property from the
coast.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_332" id="TOPIC_332"></a>It was a time of overwhelming anxiety to the ministers, for,
in addition to the expected invasion, they had to meet rebellion
in Ireland. With so great a strain upon him, Pitt was unable
to bear with patience the attempts of Tierney, the leader of the
non-seceding section of the opposition, to thwart his measures.
On May 25 he brought in a bill to abrogate certain exemptions
from naval service, and asked the house to pass it through all its
stages in one day. Tierney objected, and Pitt accused him of
desiring to obstruct the defence of the country. The speaker
ruled that the imputation was unparliamentary. Pitt repeated
his words, haughtily declaring that he would "neither retract from
nor explain them". The next day Tierney sent him a chal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>lenge.
They met on Sunday afternoon, the 27th, on Putney
heath, Pitt accompanied by his friend Dudley Ryder, afterwards
Lord Harrowby, the paymaster of the forces, and Tierney by
Colonel Walpole. Two shots were exchanged on each side
without effect, Pitt firing his second shot into the air. Honour
was then declared to be satisfied. Wilberforce, in common with
many other religious people, was much shocked, and gave notice
of a motion against duelling by members of the house, but was
persuaded to withdraw it, for Pitt threatened to resign if it was
carried. The king expressed his disapproval, telling Pitt with
characteristic good sense that a public man should remember
his duty to his country before what was due to himself. Not
until that generation had well-nigh passed away was duelling
virtually extinguished by the condemnation of society. In contrast
to the lack of moral perception on that point stands the
quickening of the public conscience with reference to the slave
trade. Wilberforce again brought in his annual motion for its
abolition. It was seconded by Pitt and vigorously supported by
Fox, who pertinently asked why the minister did not use his
majority to accomplish the end he professed to desire. It was
lost only by four votes. The rest of the session was largely
taken up by the affairs of Ireland.</p>

<p>There, as we have already seen, religious animosity strengthened
the party of rebellion. Its leaders also took advantage
of agrarian and other grievances to allure the peasantry. The
catholic peasants were little moved by the questions which
weighed with their more educated neighbours and with the
dwellers in towns. They were not enamoured of the republican
sentiments which appealed to the Ulster presbyterians, and did
not care a straw about parliamentary reform for its own sake, nor
for catholic emancipation. Their motives were more personal.
They were poor and oppressed. The national parliament,
though it refused to grant political reforms, had done much to
improve the condition of the country by subsidies for promoting
manufactures, fisheries, and canals, and by bounties on exported
corn. The financial position of Ireland was bettered, but the
lot of the peasantry grew worse. Corn bounties and the high
prices of war time caused a rise in the value of land. Holdings
were subdivided, and, as the agricultural population was large,
were eagerly taken at high rents. The tenants could not make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
a living, especially as they were ignorant and generally thriftless.
The chief cause of their discontent was the system of tithe
which pressed heavily on the small cultivators. They believed
that a reformed parliament would rid them of that intolerable
burden. Finding that reform was withheld, they readily listened
to men who bade them look for relief to France, where tithe
had been abolished. High rents, exacted by the agents of
absentee landlords or by middle-men, who rented large tracts of
land and sublet them in small holdings, were another though
lesser grievance from which they hoped to be delivered by
revolution. Sentiment urged them in the same direction.
Proud and sensitive they resented the dominance of an alien
race; they held the wrongs of their forefathers in remembrance,
and looked back with mournful longing to the age, invested by
their poetic imagination with glory and happiness, when Ireland
was yet unconquered. The United Irishmen told them that a
fresh conquest would be attempted, that the Orangemen, encouraged
by government, designed to rob them of their land
and destroy them. They looked to France for protection and
were ready to take up arms against the crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REBELLION FOILED IN ULSTER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_333" id="TOPIC_333"></a>The government was determined to nip rebellion in the bud,
and struck first at conspiracy in Ulster, where it was mainly
engineered by protestant leaders. In the spring of 1797 the
province was almost in open revolt. Martial law was proclaimed,
and on May 18 soldiers were empowered to act without authority
from a civil magistrate. An active search was made for
arms. It was carried out mainly by yeomanry and militia, for
the regular troops were few and mostly stationed in towns. The
catholic districts were ruthlessly harried. A fierce resistance
was made. Many outrages were committed by the soldiers,
specially by a Welsh regiment of mounted fencibles, the Ancient
Britons. Houses were burned and peasants were slaughtered.
Crowds were imprisoned without process of law and many were
sent off to serve in the fleet. These severities which lasted for
several months crushed the life out of the conspiracy in Ulster.
The government was justified in using force to suppress rebellion,
but it was lamentable that the work should have been
entrusted to troops which were little better than banditti. An
earnest attempt was made to restrain them by Sir Ralph Abercromby,
who succeeded Lord Carhampton as commander-in-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>chief
in November. He issued an order declaring that the
army was in a state of "licentiousness," and forbidding soldiers
to act without the civil authority. This order was contrary
to the proclamation of May 18, and gave great offence to the
party of repression in the Irish government headed by Lord
Clare, and to the British ministry. A proclamation of March
30, 1798, re-established martial law; Abercromby resigned his
command, and was succeeded by General Lake.</p>

<p>The British government upheld the Irish ministers. Early
in 1797 the Prince of Wales wished the king and Pitt to send
him to Ireland as lord-lieutenant to carry out a policy of concession.
If he had been wholly different from what he was,
such a step, though it would not perhaps have averted the
coming rebellion, would have probably rendered it less formidable
by detaching some of the leaders of the conspiracy. The prince
was not a man to be trusted, and his offer was refused. The
internal affairs of Ireland were not under English direction; the
ministers knew nothing of them except through reports from
the castle and left them to the Irish government. Addresses in
favour of conciliation were moved in the lords by the prince's
friend, Lord Moira, an Ulster magnate, and in the commons by
Fox. They were resisted as attacks on the government and
were rejected. Moira laid the excesses of the soldiers before
the lords in November and again in February, 1798. The
government refused to credit his accounts, or to interfere with
the measures taken by the Irish ministers to suppress rebellion.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_334" id="TOPIC_334"></a>The progress of the conspiracy was reported by informers,
of whom there was no lack. Great preparations were, as we
have seen, made in France for a possible invasion of England;
the United Irishmen expected that the French would land in
Ireland in the spring, and an organised army was ready to co-operate
with them, under the command of Lord Edward Fitzgerald.
The conspiracy was directed by a committee in Dublin.
One of its leaders, Arthur O'Connor, a priest named O'Coighly,
and three more were arrested at Margate while on their way to
France to make further arrangements. O'Coighly was hanged
for treason. Fox, Sheridan, and other members of the opposition
bore witness to O'Connor's character, and he and the rest
were acquitted. He was arrested on another charge and was sent
to Dublin. After the rebellion he, in common with the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
political prisoners, gave evidence as to the conspiracy, and they
were eventually released. No government is worthy of the
name that sits still and allows conspiracy to ripen unchecked.
The Irish government did not do so. It adopted measures of
repression which wrecked the plans of the conspirators and
caused secret conspiracy to break prematurely into open rebellion.
It was thus enabled to put an end to a prolonged
state of danger before it could be augmented by the anticipated
foreign invasion. It struck swiftly at the heads of the conspiracy.
In pursuance of information from an officer of the
rebel army named Reynolds, fifteen of them were arrested together
in Dublin on March 12. Fitzgerald escaped for the
time. A reward of &pound;1,000 was offered for his detection, and in
May his hiding-place was betrayed. He made a desperate resistance,
mortally wounded one of the officers sent to take him,
and was himself wounded in the arm. He was conveyed to
prison, where he died on June 4.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REPRESSIVE SEVERITIES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_335" id="TOPIC_335"></a>The government having crushed the head of rebellion in
Ulster, proceeded to combat it in the midland and southern
counties, where it was distinctly a catholic movement. Officers
were ordered to enforce disarmament by summary methods;
martial law was established, and they were enjoined to distribute
their troops at free quarters where arms were supposed
to be concealed. Scenes of cruelty sickening to contemplate
followed. As soon as a district was proclaimed, troops took up
free quarters in it, burned every house where a weapon was
discovered, shot men without trial of any kind, put many to
cruel torture either on suspicion of concealing arms or to extort
evidence, and excited the bitterest feelings of revenge by outrages
on women, cutting the petticoats from the backs of girls
who showed any sign of sympathy with rebellion, such as
wearing, it might be accidentally, a green ribbon. Men were
commonly tortured by floggings of fearful severity, or by half-hanging.
In imitation of the French republicans, the rebel
party cut their hair short, and it was a pastime with the soldiers
to torture "croppies" by fixing a covering lined with hot pitch,
a "pitch-cap," on their heads, which could not be removed without
tearing the scalp. More than one man died under the lash,
and one from fear of the torture. No name is more closely
associated with these horrors than that of Thomas Judkin Fitz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>gerald,
high-sheriff of Tipperary. Resolute, courageous, and
energetic, he united with some fine qualities a violent temper
and an insensibility to human suffering. Conspiracy was rife in
Tipperary, and he was determined to stamp it out. One instance
of his cruelties will suffice. A teacher of French named
Wright was suspected of treason, and a note of a harmless kind,
written in French, was found on him. Fitzgerald, who could
not read it, brutally assaulted him, declared that he would have
him first flogged and then shot; and failing to obtain a confession
from him, caused him to receive 150 severe lashes and
had him put in prison, where he lay for some days with his
wounds uncared for. After the rebellion Wright sued him, and
obtained &pound;500 damages. Fitzgerald's severity and the courage
with which he acted were effectual; Tipperary remained quiet.
The government paid Wright's damages, and Fitzgerald's services
were rewarded with a baronetcy.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_336" id="TOPIC_336"></a>The conspirators intended to wait for a French invasion.
Their organisation was deranged by the arrests of March 12.
A plan was made for seizing the castle and occupying Dublin.
The city was proclaimed and violent measures of repression
were adopted. A new rebel executive was broken up by the
arrest of two brothers named Sheares, who were eventually
hanged as traitors. An outbreak of rebellion was certain; it
was forced on prematurely by drastic measures of repression.
Though nothing can excuse the barbarities perpetrated under
the shield of so-called martial law, severe repression was certainly
necessary. Without it the conspiracy would have continued
to grow, and a rebellion coincident with a foreign invasion
would have been in the highest degree dangerous. The rebels
lost their leaders; their movements were paralysed in some
districts and crippled in others; they saw no hope except in
an immediate outbreak, and were driven to it by intolerable
severities. So far the system pursued by the government was
successful. Yet in some districts the terror and rage it excited
stimulated rebellion, and when rebellion broke out led to horrible
reprisals. The rising began on an appointed day, May 23.
Attacks were made on the garrisons at Naas, Clane, and other
places in Kildare. Nearly everywhere they were repulsed with
heavy loss, the catholics among the militia and yeomanry behaving
with perfect loyalty. It was a sanguinary struggle. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
rebels surprised a detachment of the North Cork militia by
night, and slaughtered them, killing many of them in their beds.
The troops gave little quarter; rebels taken in arms were commonly
flogged, shot, or hanged without trial. The citizens of
Dublin, where the rebels had been thoroughly cowed by floggings
and hangings, were zealous in preparing to defend their
city. On the south-west small bodies of troops routed the
rebels with heavy loss at Carlow and Hacketstown. The communications
of Dublin were secured on the north by a loyalist
victory at Tara, where, on the 26th, about 400 yeomanry and
fencibles defeated ten times their number of rebels, and on the
west by another victory. By the 31st the rebels in Meath,
Kildare, and Carlow had lost all heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WEXFORD REBELLION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_337" id="TOPIC_337"></a>By that time rebellion had broken out in the county of
Wexford. There it soon took the form of a religious war,
though the catholic troops remained faithful to their colours.
There were only 600 regular troops and militia in the county,
the loyalist force being composed chiefly of yeomanry, who were
generally protestants. With and without the approval of the
magistrates, they had begun to practise the usual methods of
enforcing disarmament, burning houses and flogging and half-hanging
suspected persons, and though these severities had not
as yet been practised so widely as in some other districts, they
excited violent terror and resentment. Led by a priest, Father
John Murphy, whose house or chapel had been burnt, the rebels
defeated a small number of militia at Oulart, and attacked
Enniscorthy with a force of about 7,000 men. There and elsewhere
they drove horses and cattle in front of them to disorder
the ranks of their opponents. After a stout defence the survivors
of the little garrison fled to Wexford, whither the loyal
inhabitants of the neighbourhood were flocking for protection.
The rebel army, swelled to the number of 15,000, advanced on
the town. An attempt to relieve it having failed, the garrison
made terms and evacuated the place, which was occupied by the
enemy on the 30th. The rebels chose Bagenal Harvey, a protestant
gentleman and one of the United Irishmen, as commander-in-chief,
and leaving a garrison in Wexford, established
a camp on Vinegar hill. Hoping to penetrate into Carlow and
join the rebels there and in Wicklow and Kildare, they detached
5,000 men to take Newtownbarry. Colonel L'Estrange, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
commanded there, retreated with the garrison, and the rebels
rushed into the place. He was soon persuaded to return, surprised
them as they were pillaging, and routed them with the
loss of only two men.</p>

<p>In the camp on Vinegar hill priests were dominant; mass
was said every morning, and the fury of the people was excited
by violent sermons. Protestants were brought in from the surrounding
country, and all who did not receive "protections"
from the priests were butchered, sometimes with ghastly cruelty.
Though the priests often interfered to save the captives, it is
probable that at least 400 were slain in the camp.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The prime
object of the rebel leaders was to establish communication with
other counties. Their plans were ruined by lack of discipline
and organisation, as well as by the extraordinary gallantry of
the loyalist troops. After some fighting a detachment of rebels
took Gorey in the north of the county. Instead of pressing
on into Wicklow, they remained there feasting and plundering
the neighbourhood. At the same time a large body under
Harvey marched on New Ross, with the object of opening communication
with Kilkenny and Waterford, where they believed
that thousands were ready to rise in arms.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The town was
attacked at daybreak on June 5, and was defended by General
Johnston and about 1,600 men against thousands of rebels.
Again and again the garrison, beaten back for a time by sheer
weight of numbers, rallied and steadily faced the enemy. Lord
Mountjoy was killed as he led a charge of militia. The rebels
fought desperately, but as a mere mob. After a fierce struggle
of ten hours they turned and fled through the burning town.
No quarter was given. At least 2,000 of them were slain.
The loss on the loyalist side was 230. During the battle some
rebels fled to Scullabogue House, where their army had left
224 prisoners, nearly all protestants, under a strong guard.
They declared that the day was lost, that the garrison were
slaughtering the catholics, and that Harvey had ordered that
the prisoners should be killed. Thirty-seven were massacred at
the hall door, and 184, including some women and children,
were shut into a barn and burned to death. Out of the whole
number only three escaped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF ARKLOW.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_338" id="TOPIC_338"></a>After his defeat at New Ross, Harvey, who tried in vain to
check the savagery of his followers, was deposed from his command,
and was succeeded by a priest named Philip Roche. The
rebels at Gorey had been wasting their time. They were largely
reinforced, and on the 9th some 10,000 men attacked Arklow.
Its capture would have thrown open the road to Dublin. The
garrison under General Needham numbered about 1,500, and
had some cannon. Mainly owing to the splendid courage of the
Durham fencibles they defeated the rebels, who were much discouraged
by the fall of one of their priests, for they believed
that he and some of their other priestly leaders could not be
harmed by shot or sword. Their defeat decided the issue of the
rebellion. It was almost confined to Leinster. Connaught remained
quiet, and it scarcely touched Munster. In Ulster, the
chief seat of the conspiracy, there were only two outbreaks, in
Antrim and Down, which were easily suppressed. Severity
had nipped rebellion in the bud. Nor was this the only reason
for the comparative inaction of the province. The presbyterians,
whose republican sympathies had led them to look to France
and seek the support of the catholics against England, found
France fail them again and again; and they were bitterly incensed
against the catholics on hearing how in Wexford they
made the rebellion a religious war and were torturing and massacring
the protestants. Nor were French politics any longer
such as to allure republicans, for France was rapidly tending
towards military rule, and was bringing the republics she had
founded into subjection to herself. Before long Ulster became,
as it has since remained, thoroughly loyal to the crown.</p>

<p>The rebellion was defeated by the gallantry of the Irish
loyalists and the few English troops which supported them.
No help had as yet been sent from England. Decisive as the
battle of Arklow proved to be, the Irish ministers believed that
the rebellion was still likely to grow, and wrote urgently for
reinforcements. Five regiments were despatched, and several
militia regiments volunteered for service in Ireland. The crown
could not accept their offer without the consent of parliament.
The opposition in the commons raised objections, and were defeated
by a large majority. On the 21st Lake, at the head of
an army of over 13,000 men, attacked the rebels on Vinegar hill.
After a short resistance they fled in confusion. Enniscorthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
was taken, and the royal army marched on Wexford. When
the rebels occupied Wexford on May 30, they behaved with
comparative moderation. There was some pillaging, but few
acts of violence were committed. Many protestants were imprisoned,
and the rest were confined to their houses and lived in
mortal terror, for the lower class of catholics showed a savage
spirit which was only kept in check by their leaders. It broke
out on June 20, when nearly all the armed rebels had marched
out against the royal forces. Infuriated by the news of disasters,
the mob, under the leadership of a ruffian named Dixon and his
equally savage wife, slaughtered ninety-seven of the prisoners.
The next day the rebels offered to surrender the town on terms.
They believed that their offer was accepted, and surrendered
before they heard that Lake refused it. The rebel leaders
and all found guilty of murder were executed. Philip Roche
and, in spite of his humane exertions, Harvey were among
the number. The remains of the rebellion were stamped out
with fearful severity. Many excesses were committed. Every
execution was hailed with exultation by the victorious party.
Cornwallis, who had succeeded Camden as lord-lieutenant in
June, was disgusted with their bloodthirsty and vengeful spirit.
Seconded by the chancellor, he obtained from parliament an act
of general indemnity with special exceptions, and did all in his
power to restrain the ferocity of the troops.</p>

<p>The rebellion left Ireland burdened with debt. Throughout
wide districts the land lay waste, houses were in ashes, the
peasants homeless and starving. Old racial and religious hatreds
were revived and were strengthened a thousandfold by the barbarities
perpetrated by both parties. If Ireland was ever to
be at peace, if Celts and Saxons, catholics and protestants, were
ever to dwell together as one people, it could only be by her
acceptance of the control of a single imperial parliament. A
legislative union had long been contemplated by Pitt and by
other English statesmen. That Pitt deliberately planned and
fostered the rebellion, as Irishmen have actually asserted, in
order to carry out a union is a charge so monstrous as scarcely
to demand serious refutation. It is enough to say that he would
certainly not have chosen to have Ireland in rebellion at a time
so critical for England as the spring of 1798. That the policy
of the government both in England and Ireland, which certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
conduced to the rebellion, was to some extent swayed by the
desire for union is probable.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> That is quite another matter.
The rebellion made union absolutely necessary, and while the
rebels were still in arms, Pitt began to prepare for it. The
history of the union must be deferred to our next chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HUMBERT'S INVASION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_339" id="TOPIC_339"></a>The rebels' hopes of help from France were bitterly disappointed.
A serious invasion was impossible without command
of the sea; only small expeditions could be sent out by stealth.
On June 16 certain Irish conspirators represented that if a small
expedition landed on the north-west coast the independence of
Ireland might be secured. The directors determined to send
one immediately.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> It was long delayed, for the navy was in disorder.
At last, on August 6, when the rebellion was over, and
Ireland was full of troops, General Humbert sailed from Rochelle
with eighty-two officers and 1,017 men, together with supplies
and arms for the natives, in three frigates under the command
of Captain Savary. The ships took a long route to avoid the
British fleet, and did not arrive in Killala bay until the 20th.
Killala, which had a garrison of only 200 men, was occupied,
and Ballina was taken. The French were joined by a large
number of Irish, delighted at receiving arms, clothes, and food.
Many of these recruits deserted, carrying away their guns, and
those who remained were of little use. General Hutchinson, who
commanded in Connaught, advanced against the invaders. He
was joined by Lake, and their forces amounted to over 5,000 men.
Lake posted a detachment to guard Castlebar. Humbert avoided
it by crossing the mountains, and on the 27th, after a march of
fifteen hours engaged the British, though vastly inferior to them
in number. The militia were seized with panic, and though the
artillery behaved well, the army was utterly routed and fled in
disorder leaving nine guns in the enemy's hands.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_340" id="TOPIC_340"></a>After this shameful rout, called "the race of Castlebar," Cornwallis
took the command in person at the head of a large army,
and reached the neighbourhood of Castlebar on September 4.
Early on that day Humbert left Castlebar to march on Sligo, for
he heard that there were few troops in the counties of Sligo and
Leitrim. He probably intended to maintain himself near the
sea in order to meet reinforcements from France, and is said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
have hoped to reach Dublin by a circuit to the north-east. Wild
as this hope seems, it was encouraged by the news of insurrectionary
movements. On reaching Colooney he was met by
Colonel Vereker with a small force from Sligo, which he defeated
after a smart engagement. He abruptly changed his course
and marched to the south-east, either because he believed that
Vereker's force was the vanguard of an army, or because he
hoped to take advantage of a rebellion which had broken out in
Granard, and of disaffection in Longford and Westmeath, and
to reach Dublin through those counties.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> On the 9th Lake
attacked him with an overwhelming force at Ballinamuck, near
Granard; Cornwallis was marching on his rear, and after a short
resistance the French surrendered themselves prisoners. They
then numbered ninety-six officers and 748 men. No terms were
granted to their Irish allies of whom 500 are said to have been
slain. The adventure, gallantry, and achievements of Humbert's
little band form a notable episode in the military history
of France. Their conduct was worthy of their country, for they
committed no excesses. Killala was retaken from the rebels with
great slaughter and the rebellion in Connaught was soon at an end.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_341" id="TOPIC_341"></a>The expedition under General Hardy, which was to have
sailed to support Humbert, was prevented from leaving Brest
by the British fleet. From Dunkirk a brig got away on
September 4, carrying Napper Tandy and some other United
Irishmen, a few soldiers, and stores. Tandy persuaded the
French that he was a man of importance in Ireland, and that
if he appeared there the people would rise in arms; so the
French made him a general, and gave him command of this
little expedition. He reached the island of Aran, in Donegal,
on the 16th, and heard of Humbert's failure. No one paid any
heed to him. He read the letters in the post office, hoisted a
green flag, got very drunk, and was carried back to the brig
eight hours after landing. The brig sailed to the coast of Norway
to avoid capture. Finally Tandy and some of his friends
took refuge in Hamburg. The city delivered them up to the
English and thereby incurred the wrath of Bonaparte. They
were sentenced to death but were not executed, and Tandy was
allowed to go to France, where he ended his days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ABORTIVE ATTEMPTS ON IRELAND.</i></div>

<p>At last, on September 16th, Hardy succeeded in sailing out
from the Raz with 4,000 troops for the relief of Humbert. They
were carried in the <i>Hoche</i> (80) and nine smaller ships, under
Admiral Bompard. The French took a wide course and arrived
off Lough Swilly on October 10. They were met the next day
by Sir John Warren with three ships of the line and five frigates.
The French, who fought well, were overpowered. The <i>Hoche</i>
and three of their frigates surrendered, and three more of their
vessels were caught during the next few days. Only two frigates
and a sloop returned to Brest. On the <i>Hoche</i> was Wolfe Tone,
who had embarked as a French officer. He was tried by court-martial
in Dublin and sentenced to be hanged. His request
that he might die a soldier's death was refused; he cut his
throat and died in prison. Of all the promoters of the rebellion
he was, perhaps, the most talented, and was excelled by none
either in courage or in whole-hearted devotion to the cause of
Irish independence. One more attempt at invasion was made
by Savary, who after landing Humbert's force had returned to
France. Ignorant of the fate of Humbert's expedition, he sailed
from Rochelle on October 12 with three frigates and a corvette,
carrying 1,090 troops, and appeared off Killala on the 27th.
There he heard of the failure of both Humbert and Bompard.
He set sail again and was so hotly chased by some British ships
that he threw guns, stores, and ammunition overboard.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> His
ships got away, though with some damage, and returned to
Rochelle. So ended the French attempts on Ireland. If in
the height of the rebellion a small expedition had succeeded, as
Humbert did, in evading the British fleet and had landed in
Ireland, it might have prolonged the struggle, but could not
have changed its issue. Disorganisation and unreadiness prevented
France from seizing the opportunity of doing even so
much as that. In the face of England's superiority at sea the
despatch of any large force would have ended in signal disaster.
Independently of the risk of capture at sea, the little secret expeditions
to which France was reduced were a mere waste of
money.</p>

<p>Bonaparte sailed from Toulon on May 19, intending to take
Malta, conquer Egypt, despoil England of her power and com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>merce
in the east, and gain for France exclusive possession of
the Red sea. He had with him 35,000 troops, and a fleet, which
finally amounted to thirteen ships of the line, fourteen frigates,
and a vast number of smaller vessels, under the subordinate
command of Admiral Brueys. Malta was surrendered by the
knights of St. John. Bonaparte took Alexandria on July 2, and
defeated the Mamelukes in the battle of the Pyramids on the
21st. Lower Egypt was conquered. As the port of Alexandria
was unsuitable for his fleet, Brueys stationed it in Abukir bay,
near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile, in order to guard the rear
of the army. So far Bonaparte's schemes were successful. But
they had been formed without taking the British navy into
account. Nelson again entered the Mediterranean. Acting on
orders from the admiralty, St. Vincent sent him thither, and by
June 7 he was in command of thirteen ships of seventy-four,
and the <i>Leander</i> of fifty guns. He at once began a long search
for the French fleet, in which he was hindered through lack of
frigates to do scouting work. He anchored off Naples on the
17th, and believing that the enemy would attack Sicily, passed
through the straits of Messina, and sailed along the east of the
island. He was off Alexandria on the 28th, two days before the
French arrived there, then he searched the Levant, and returned
to Sicily for supplies on July 19. On the 25th he put to sea
again, sailed along the coast of the Morea, and finally on August 1
discovered the enemy in Abukir bay. The French fleet was
anchored in line on the western side of the bay, with wide shoals
between it and the shore. It was sheltered by Abukir (now
Nelson's) island and its rocks, and its leading ship was pretty
close to the shoal off the island. It was composed of thirteen
ships of the line and four frigates, and was much superior to
Nelson's in the size of the ships and weight of metal. Some
of the ships, however, were worn out, and many of their crews
were not seamen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF THE NILE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_342" id="TOPIC_342"></a>Though Troubridge's ship, the <i>Culloden</i>, and two others
were not with the main body, Nelson would not delay his
attack, and at 5.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> formed his line of battle, the wind
being N.N.W. and blowing down the French line. Very skilfully
the British ships were taken round the island and the
shoals. They then swept round, and steering to the south-west
headed for the French van about 6.30, led by the <i>Goliath</i> under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
Captain Foley. Near as the leading French ship, the <i>Guerrier</i>
(74), was to the shoal, Foley passed across her bows, and engaged
the next ship, the <i>Conqu&eacute;rant</i> (74), on the inshore side.
Hood followed with the <i>Zealous</i>, and anchored by the <i>Guerrier</i>,
and three more engaged on the enemy's port side, Nelson's ship,
the <i>Vanguard</i>, and the two next attacking on the outside. Eight
British ships set on the five of the French van, the two others
engaged two Frenchmen of much larger size in the centre, and
one of them, the <i>Bellerophon</i>, was dismasted and drifted off.
Later two of the missing ships of Nelson's squadron and the
<i>Leander</i> came into action; the <i>Culloden</i> having struck on a rock
off the island, remained aground. By that time the French van
was crushed, and the battle raged round the centre. Brueys
fell, and soon afterwards his ship, the <i>Orient</i> (120), caught fire.
Her assailants poured so fierce a storm of shot upon her that
her crew could not get the fire under. The summer night was
lightened by the sheet of flame which wrapped her from the
water-line to the mast-heads. The fire reached her magazine,
and the great ship blew up with a terrific explosion. During
the fight Nelson was badly wounded in the forehead. He was
soon on deck again, and sent boats to pick up the survivors of
the crew of the <i>Orient</i>. The British victory was completed in
the morning, and never was victory so complete. Of seventeen
French ships two were burnt besides the <i>Orient</i>, one sank, nine
were taken, and only two ships of the line and two frigates
escaped.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Great was the rejoicing in England at the news of
the battle of the Nile. Nelson was raised to the peerage as
Baron Nelson of the Nile and Burnham Thorpe; other honours
were conferred on him both at home and by foreign sovereigns,
and parliament voted him a pension of &pound;2,000 a year for two
lives.</p>

<p>The king's speech on November 20 described the victory
as foiling an enterprise against the most valuable interests of
the British empire, and as likely to lead other powers to combine
for the general deliverance of Europe. Let us trace its
effects under these two headings. Bonaparte's conquest of
Egypt was designed to be a step towards the overthrow of
British power and commerce in the east. He found himself shut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
up in his conquest. Great ideas presented themselves to him.
He would take Constantinople, and conquer Europe by a flank
attack. He would be a second Alexander, and after another
Issos would drive the English from India. Already French
envoys were inciting Tip&uacute; Sult&aacute;n to war. From the shores of
the Red sea Bonaparte wrote to bid him expect his army. The
letter was seized by a British ship. Nelson's victory encouraged
the sultan, Selim III., the nominal lord of Egypt, to declare
war. A Turkish army and fleet were assembled at Rhodes,
and another army in Syria. Bonaparte did not wait to be
attacked in Egypt. The conquest of Syria would deprive the
British fleet of its source of supplies in the Levant, and would
open the way to a conquest either of Constantinople or Delhi.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
On February 15, 1799, he captured El Arish, and on March 6
took Jaffa by storm. Then with an army weakened by disease
and fighting, he marched on Acre. There he again had to meet
a British sea-captain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEFENCE OF ACRE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_343" id="TOPIC_343"></a>After his distinguished service at Toulon, and some later
employment, Sir Sidney Smith, in 1795, was appointed to the
command of some small vessels with which he did much damage
to the enemy off the Norman coast. He was taken prisoner in
1796 and kept in France for eighteen months. He escaped in
1798 with the help of a royalist officer of engineers, Colonel
Ph&eacute;lypeaux, was sent to Constantinople as joint-plenipotentiary
with his brother, and, Nelson being at Naples, became senior
naval officer in the Levant. Acre, as the best harbour on the
Syrian coast, was specially important to British maritime supremacy
in those waters. So long as it remained uncaptured,
Bonaparte could not advance, for the door would be left open
to an attack on his rear. If he took the place, he believed that
Syria would rise against Djezzar, its Turkish ruler. The fortifications
were weak, but Nelson's victory deprived him of the
power of investing it by sea. Smith sent his friend, Ph&eacute;lypeaux,
in the <i>Theseus</i> (74) to teach the Turks how to strengthen
the place, and followed himself in the <i>Tigre</i> (74). On
March 18 he intercepted a French flotilla with the artillery,
ammunition, and stores on which Bonaparte depended for the
siege. They were brought into Acre; the French were left only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
with field-pieces, and it was not until April 25 that they could
bring up heavy guns from Jaffa. Much fierce fighting took
place between the Turks and the French; and the British ships
kept up a constant fire on the French in their lines and whenever
they advanced to attack. Smith, who was given to vapouring,
was offended by some communication from Bonaparte, and
sent him a challenge to which Bonaparte replied that he would
fight when the English sent a Marlborough to meet him.</p>

<p>Bonaparte's victory over the Turks at Mount Tabor seemed
a great step towards conquest. All depended on the fate of
Acre. At last on May 7 the Turkish fleet from Rhodes hove
in sight. It was becalmed, and the French made a desperate
attempt to storm the place before the reinforcements could
arrive. They effected a lodgment, but Smith landed his seamen
who helped to drive them out with their pikes, and they fell
back with heavy loss. On the 20th Bonaparte raised the siege
which had cost him nearly 5,000 men by war and sickness.
Smith received the thanks of parliament and a pension of
&pound;1,000 a year. Though vainglorious and arrogant, he conducted
the defence of Acre with sound judgment as well as
with energy and courage. By weary marches through the
desert, Bonaparte led his army back to Egypt, where he defeated
an invasion of Turks. Smith sent him a bundle of newspapers,
and from them he received tidings which determined
him to leave his army and return to France. Before we enter
on the European events which chiefly led to his return, let us
see how the ruin of his plan of eastern conquest, the fruit of
Nelson's victory, affected the British rule in India.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_344" id="TOPIC_344"></a>By reducing the resources of Tip&uacute; in 1792 Cornwallis
believed that he was establishing a balance of power in India
which would enable the English to adopt a policy of nonintervention.
This policy was pursued both by him and his
successor, Sir John Shore, afterwards Lord Teignmouth. It
was defeated through the revival of French influence. The
niz&aacute;m put his army under French officers who held a large part
of his territories and paid their troops out of their revenues.
Daulat R&aacute;o Sindhia, the strongest of the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; lords, also
employed French officers and was inclined to help Tip&uacute; rather
than the English. From neither of these powers, which were
in alliance with the company in Cornwallis's war with Tip&uacute;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
could any help be expected in a fresh struggle with him; and
as in 1797 Tip&uacute; proposed an alliance with France against the
English, a struggle could not be far off. In October of that
year Pitt's friend, Lord Mornington, was appointed governor-general.
On the day that he reached Madras, in April, 1798,
Tip&uacute; received a French force from Mauritius. Mornington at
once persuaded the niz&aacute;m to enter into a subsidiary treaty by
which he agreed to dismiss his French officers and to form a
close alliance with the company. The Frenchmen were made
prisoners and his army was placed under British officers. Bonaparte's
expedition to Egypt encouraged Tip&uacute; in his hostility,
for he expected that a French army would shortly appear in
India. This hope was frustrated by Nelson's victory. Nevertheless,
he believed that the time would come when he would be
able to co-operate with a French invasion; he tried to play a
waiting game, and evaded the British attempts at pacification.
Mornington determined to put an end to his subterfuges, and,
in February, 1799, ordered an invasion of Mysore under General
Harris, the governor of Madras. Harris's army was joined by
the army of the niz&aacute;m, and, on March 27, routed Tip&uacute; at Malvalli,
the left wing of the British, which consisted mainly of the
niz&aacute;m's contingent, being under the command of Mornington's
brother, Sir Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington.
Seringapatam was taken by storm and Tip&uacute; was slain. Mornington,
who was created Marquis Wellesley, partitioned Mysore, set
up a youthful r&aacute;j&aacute;, and placed him under British protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A NEW COALITION PROPOSED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_345" id="TOPIC_345"></a>While Nelson's victory enabled Englishmen to uphold the
power and interests of their country in the east, it led also to a
second coalition against France. Already mistress of the Batavian,
Cisalpine, and Ligurian republics, France occupied Rome
in February, 1798, drove out Pius VI., and founded a Roman republic.
In August, the Helvetic republic, established partly by
intrigue and partly by force, in place of the Swiss confederation,
became her dependent ally. The German empire was hopelessly
divided, Piedmont was in process of annexation, Naples was
threatened. Yet the power of France was not so great as it
seemed. Among the peoples of the new republics many resented
the destruction of their old independent governments.
Pitt poured money from the secret service funds into the hands
of agents, who in every country of Europe recruited for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
interest of England. He seems generally to have received a
good return, except in Holland, where the democratic party
remained strong. In other lands the rising feeling against
France was of no small importance in the coming struggle.</p>

<p>Paul, the Russian tsar, was deeply offended by the capture of
Malta, for he had a romantic predilection for the order of St.
John, of which he constituted himself the protector. The eastward
advance of the French seemed to threaten the spread of
republicanism to his dominions and the revival of trouble in
Poland. Encouraged by Nelson's victory, he incited the Porte
to declare war on France, sent ships to act with the British and
Portuguese squadrons in the Mediterranean, and formed a defensive
alliance with the Turks to which England acceded.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
He tried in vain to induce the courts of Berlin and Vienna to
combine against France, and appears to have made a secret
treaty with Austria concerning the passage of troops, for some
60,000 Russians were soon marching towards the Danube.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Pitt eagerly took advantage of the tsar's disposition. Grenville
promised a subsidy if the tsar would enter on the war as a
principal,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> and on November 16 bade Sir Charles Whitworth,
the British ambassador at St. Petersburg, propose a coalition
between England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia to support
Naples, re-establish Austria in Italy, drive the French from
Holland, the Belgian Netherlands, Switzerland, and Savoy, and
join the Netherlands to Holland to form a strong barrier state.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
Frederick William III., who succeeded his father in 1797, would
not be moved from his neutrality. Russia was only waiting for
the arrangement of a subsidy. With Austria there were difficulties.
The emperor, disgusted with the greediness of France,
was fully determined on war, but wanted a loan of &pound;2,000,000.
As England had lost by former transactions with Austria,
Pitt would make no further promise until existing obligations
had been fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Besides, the imperial minister Thugut was
anxious for delay; he hoped that the directory would be
crushed by its own difficulties, and in any case was unwilling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
to move without the co-operation of Prussia, or before Russia
could enter on the campaign. He had formed a defensive
alliance between Austria and the Two Sicilies, or Naples, on
May 19, but declared that Austria would only support Naples
if France was the aggressor, and would give no help if Naples
began the war.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>His plans were disconcerted by the action of Ferdinand IV.
of Naples. After the battle of the Nile the British fleet in the
Mediterranean was broken up and employed in different directions.
Nelson himself sailed to Naples, was received as its deliverer,
and was ensnared by the charms of Emma, the wife of
Sir William Hamilton, the British minister. She was a woman
of low birth, and in her youth had entered on an immoral life.
Though grown stout she was still beautiful, and her considerable
natural talents had been improved by Charles Greville, under
whose protection she had lived. He passed her over to Hamilton,
who married her in 1791. Queen Maria Caroline made a
favourite of her, and used her for political ends, for the queen
was anxious for British help against the French and the Neapolitan
republicans. Under court and female influences, Nelson,
who had been ordered to protect Naples, came to consider its
fortunes as of the first importance. The queen, far bolder and
more energetic than her husband, was bent on war. Mack, the
Austrian strategist, took command of the army, and by Nelson's
advice Ferdinand declared war on France. Nelson assisted the
operations by carrying troops to Leghorn. Ferdinand entered
Rome in triumph on November 29. His triumph was short-lived;
the Neapolitans were routed by the French, and Naples
was threatened. On December 23 the king and queen and
their court took refuge on board Nelson's ship, the <i>Vanguard</i>,
and her companions, and Nelson conveyed them to Palermo
and remained with them there. The French occupied Naples
and the Parthenopean republic was established on the mainland
of the Two Sicilies. Among other operations in the Mediterranean
a small British force took Minorca from the Spaniards
in November without the loss of a man, and British and Portuguese
ships blockaded Valetta and compelled the surrender of
Gozo. In order to avoid offending the tsar, or exciting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
jealousy of the Austrian or Neapolitan courts, England renounced
all desire for conquest either as regards Malta, where
she proposed that the knights should be re-established, or the
Adriatic, where Turkish and Russian ships were attacking the
French in the former possessions of Venice.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SECOND COALITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_346" id="TOPIC_346"></a>The ill-advised action of Ferdinand of Naples, for which Nelson
was largely responsible, caused some embarrassment to the
English government, and Grenville anxiously assured Thugut
that England was not responsible for it.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> At the same time
it hastened the formation of the second coalition. A treaty of
close alliance with Naples was signed by Russia on November
29, and another by the Porte on December 23, to which Great
Britain acceded on January 2.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> England further made a treaty
with Russia on December 29 by which the tsar agreed to furnish
45,000 men to act against France in co-operation with Prussia,
and England promised a subsidy of &pound;225,000 for initial expenses
and &pound;75,000 a month afterwards. Thomas Grenville
was sent to Berlin to act with Count Panin in persuading
Frederick William to join the coalition. The king refused;
the treaty with Russia was modified by a mutual agreement
that the Russian troops should be employed as seemed most
advantageous to both powers, and the English government
suggested that they should act with the Austrians in Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
Austria was soon forced to abandon her temporising
policy. A corps of 25,000 Russians was encamped on the
Danube. France demanded their expulsion from Austrian territory,
and that, as Thugut said, meant war.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> On February
28 Jourdan crossed the Rhine with 40,000 men. The second
coalition of which England was the soul was a direct result of
the battle of the Nile.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_347" id="TOPIC_347"></a>England was successful alike in arms and diplomacy. She
had crushed a long-threatened rebellion and had been unharmed
by attempts at invasion. Her fleet had vindicated her naval
supremacy in the Mediterranean; Bonaparte's great design<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
against her commerce and power in the east had utterly failed,
and she had succeeded for the second time in forming a coalition
against the common enemy. Though she was burdened with
taxation and debt, and suffering from the evils of a prolonged
war, her commerce was increasing and sedition was virtually
extinct. In one quarter only is an almost insignificant failure
to be recorded. The attempt to conquer San Domingo with insufficient
forces, in which the government had persevered since
1793, was abandoned. Animated by republican sentiments, the
negroes raised a large army under a former slave, Toussaint
l'Ouverture. The small British force at Port-au-Prince could
make no head against them, and was withdrawn in 1798.
France shortly afterwards withdrew her forces, and Toussaint
remained virtually master of the island. England's failure entailed
no real loss. She acknowledged the neutrality of San
Domingo, and Toussaint opened its ports to her commerce and
prevented France from using them for privateering purposes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>ISOLATION IN EUROPE AND THE IRISH UNION.</p>


<p><a name="TOPIC_348" id="TOPIC_348"></a>During the earlier part of the war of the second coalition in
1799 the allies gained a series of victories. In Germany Jourdan
was defeated by the Archduke Charles in the country between
the Lake of Constance and the Danube, and the French
withdrew across the Rhine. In Italy they were repulsed by the
Austrians, retreated across the Mincio and, on April 12, fell
back behind the Adda. Then a Russian army joined the
Austrians, and Suvorov, the captor of Ismail, took command
of the allied forces. He conquered Lombardy at the battle of
Cassano on the 27th-29th. Moreau retreated behind the Ticino,
and called on Macdonald to bring his army from Naples to help
him. Suvorov's blows fell in quick succession; he advanced
into Piedmont, cut Moreau off from communication with Mass&eacute;na,
who was operating in Switzerland, and invited Charles Emanuel,
who had been forced to abdicate his continental possessions, to
return to Turin. Everywhere the Italian people rose against the
French. Suvorov designed to crush Moreau and Macdonald
separately, to cross the Alps, and restore the French monarchy.
He was thwarted by the Austrian court. Thugut disapproved
of the proposed restoration of the King of Sardinia, for he was
set on the aggrandisement of Austria at the expense of Piedmont.
The tsar aimed at the re-establishment of the old order
in Europe, the emperor at the increase of his own dominions.
Suvorov, though indignant at Austrian opposition, turned to
the work immediately before him, and inflicted a crushing defeat
on Macdonald at the Trebbia on June 19. Macdonald made a
rapid retreat, and finally led his shattered army to Genoa. A
new French army was defeated by Suvorov at Novi on August
15, its commander, Joubert, falling early in the battle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p>The English government approved of the emperor's designs
on Piedmont, for under a strong power the country would be a
barrier to French aggression,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> and as the difference of policy
between Austria and Russia hindered the progress of the war,
devised a plan for bringing them into accord as regards operations.
Suvorov, after completing the conquest of Italy, was to
enter Switzerland and prosecute his intended invasion of France;
the Austrians were to remain in occupation of Piedmont and
enter France by Savoy, while the archduke was to act on the
Rhine where his presence would forward a scheme for an invasion
of Holland by England and Russia. During the spring and
summer the archduke had been struggling with Mass&eacute;na in
Switzerland without making much progress, though in August
the French evacuated the Grisons country. Shortly before he
left for the upper Rhine he was joined by a new Russian army
under Korsakov. After his departure Mass&eacute;na utterly defeated
Korsakov and his Austrian allies near Z&uuml;rich on September 26.
When, then, Suvorov had, in spite of great hardships, led his
army over the St. Gothard, he found his whole plan of campaign
overset and his position seriously endangered by Korsakov's
defeat. He abandoned the campaign, and at the head of only
25,000 men of the 70,000 sent by the tsar to the war, retired
into Germany. In the Mediterranean, Corfu, the other Venetian
islands, and several important posts were captured by the combined
Russian and Turkish squadrons. Valetta was closely
besieged under Nelson's direction; Italy was virtually lost to
the French, though they still held Genoa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NELSON AT NAPLES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_349" id="TOPIC_349"></a>England bore a part in the war both by sea and land. On
April 25 a powerful French fleet slipped out from Brest. All
the southern coast of England was disturbed by the fear of
invasion. The French, however, sailed into the Mediterranean.
The fleet under St. Vincent was scattered on different services
and each division was far weaker than the French, who were
expected at Naples, at Malta, and at Alexandria. A crisis was
impending at Naples. The upper and middle classes were
largely republican, the poor throughout the kingdom were
attached to the monarchy. In February, Cardinal Ruffo, as the
king's vicar-general, set on foot a counter-revolution. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
head of a horde of peasants he quickly regained Calabria for
the king, while a Neapolitan diplomatist, Micheroux, with the
help of some Russian and Turkish ships, won back Apulia.
On April 3 Troubridge captured Procida and Ischia from the
republicans, but on the arrival of the French fleet in the Mediterranean,
was summoned by Nelson to join him at Maritimo, and
left only one British ship off Naples under Captain Foote. On
June 13, after Macdonald had withdrawn his army, the bands of
Ruffo and Micheroux entered Naples and took cruel vengeance
on the republicans. The castle of St. Elmo, held by a French
garrison, and the castles Dell' Uovo and Nuovo by Neapolitan
republicans, were besieged by the royalists, by Foote, and by the
Russian and Turkish allies. Both sides expected the arrival of
the French fleet, and Ruffo was anxious to gain speedy possession
of the forts. An armistice was arranged, and on the 19th
a capitulation of the forts Dell' Uovo and Nuovo was agreed
upon, was signed by Ruffo, Foote, and the Russian and Turkish
commanders, and was ratified by the French commandant of
St. Elmo.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_350" id="TOPIC_350"></a>The capitulation provided that the rebels should surrender
the two forts and evacuate them unharmed as soon as transports
should be ready to convey to Toulon such of them as desired
to depart. On the 21st Nelson, after an interview with the
king, sailed from Palermo for Naples. As soon as he arrived,
on the 24th, he signalled to annul the armistice, and sent word
to Ruffo that he disallowed the capitulation. The next day he
sent Ruffo a declaration that he should not allow the rebels to
embark; they must surrender to the king's mercy, and he bade
Ruffo inform them of his decision. Ruffo refused, and remonstrated
in person with Nelson, who gave him a written "opinion"
that the capitulation could not be carried out without the king's
approbation. The cardinal then sent the rebels Nelson's declaration.
On the 26th Nelson promised him that he would
not break the armistice and, further, sent him word that he
would not oppose the embarkation of the rebels. Did not
Ruffo, anxious for British help in case the French and the
rebels should renew hostilities, yield to Nelson's opinion that
the question of the capitulation should be reserved for the
king? We have no absolute proof that this was so, but Sir
John Acton, Ferdinand's minister, in a letter of August 1, says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
that the king pardoned Ruffo because he yielded to Nelson's
wise declarations.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> After receiving a communication from
Ruffo, Micheroux informed the rebels, no doubt in good faith,
that Nelson had consented to the capitulation. The evacuation
was arranged, and the rebels embarked that evening in the belief
that they would be allowed to proceed to Toulon. Nelson
prevented the transports from leaving the harbour. The king
disallowed the capitulation, and put to death a large number of
the rebels.</p>

<p>Such are the main outlines of this extremely complicated
affair. It is certain that Ruffo exceeded his authority in arranging
the capitulation, and that Nelson knew and carried out
the king's wishes. He evidently acted with full authority; he
neither changed his opinion as regards the capitulation nor did
he deceive either Ruffo or the rebels. That the rebels were
deceived is certain, but for that Ruffo was responsible, though
he may only have been guilty of gross carelessness in not making
Micheroux understand the position of affairs. But Nelson's
conduct was not creditable. The capitulation was not less valid
because Ruffo acted disobediently in arranging it, and it was
signed by a British captain. Nelson was justified in suspending
its execution until King Ferdinand's will was declared; but, as
the rebels could not then be restored to the position they held
before it was made, he was bound to use every effort to induce
the king not to break it, and to allow the rebels to proceed
to Toulon. Unfortunately he had imbibed the vengeful spirit
of the Neapolitan court. Blinded by the blandishments of his
mistress and the flattery of the court, he forgot the conduct
which became a British admiral and the representative of his
own sovereign, and pandered to the cruel desires of the Bourbon
king and queen for vengeance on those who had revolted against
their detestable government.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>With the fate of one Neapolitan rebel Nelson was immediately
concerned. Francesco Caracciolo, formerly commander of
the royal fleet, had joined the republicans, taken command of
their vessels, and fired on his king's frigate, the <i>Minerva</i>. He
escaped from Naples on June 17, and so was not included in the
capitulation; he was arrested, and on Nelson's repeated request
was handed over to him by Ruffo on the 29th. Nelson immediately
ordered the captain of the <i>Minerva</i> and other royal
officers to try him by court-martial on board his own flagship,
the <i>Foudroyant</i>. Caracciolo was found guilty of treason, and
sentenced to death with ignominy. Nelson ordered that he
should be hanged that same evening from the yard-arm of the
<i>Minerva</i>, which was accordingly done. He was forty-seven at
the time of his death. His treason was patent, and its penalty
inevitable. Although Nelson does not appear to have received
any written commission from Ferdinand, he evidently had a right
to order the court-martial and to enforce its sentence,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> but the
eagerness with which he acted and the indecent haste of the
execution are lamentable illustrations of his animosity. The
garrison of St. Elmo surrendered on terms, and the royal power
was re-established in Naples. The French fleet was still in the
Mediterranean. Large as it was, it did nothing of importance,
save effecting a junction with the fleet of Spain. The combined
fleets reached Brest in September, outstripping the pursuit
of the British under Lord Keith, who succeeded St. Vincent as
commander-in-chief. In April, 1800, St. Vincent took command
of the channel fleet and instituted a strict blockade of Brest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXPEDITION TO THE HELDER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_351" id="TOPIC_351"></a>On June 22, 1799, Pitt made a convention with Russia for
a joint invasion of Holland. On the part of England the principal
object was the capture of the Dutch fleet in the Texel and
the destruction of the naval dep&ocirc;t, which would deprive France
of maritime aid from Holland, while both the allied powers
hoped to follow up the Austrian successes by threatening the
French frontier. It was expected that the Orange party would
be strong enough to give the invaders effectual help and that
the Dutch would rise against the French. The tsar promised
17,500 men, and England agreed to send 13,000, to pay the
tsar &pound;88,000 for first expenses, and a subsidy of &pound;44,000 a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
month, and to provide transports and horses. On August 27
a British force of 10,000 men under Sir Ralph Abercromby
landed at the Helder, a point by no means suited for an invasion,
which was chosen on account of its proximity to the
Dutch fleet. Abercromby repulsed an attack of the Dutch
and threw open the Texel to the British ships, under Admiral
Mitchell. The Dutch seamen, who were attached to the house
of Orange, forced their officers to hoist the prince's flag, and
the fleet, consisting of thirteen ships carrying from sixty-four
to forty-four guns and other smaller vessels, surrendered, and
was carried to Yarmouth. The arrival of the Russians was
delayed, and the republicans had time to make preparations
for defence. Brune, a French general, took command of the
combined French and Dutch forces, and failing in an attempt
on the British position, established his quarters before Alkmaar.</p>

<p>On September 12 the first division of the Russians arrived,
and reinforcements from England brought up the number of the
combined army to about 30,000 men. The Duke of York
was ostensibly in command, but the cabinet ordered that all
operations should be directed by a standing council of war. A
general advance was attempted on the 18th-19th. It was not
well planned, and failed owing chiefly to the undisciplined impetuosity
of the Russians on the right wing. The British lost
over 1,000 killed and wounded, the Russians about 2,500, but
the allies took some 3,000 prisoners, mostly Dutch. Heavy
rains set in; the republicans broke up the roads and laid the
country in front of the allies under water. The invaders, cooped
up in a sandy corner of land, were in a sorry plight. A fresh
advance was attempted on October 2; there was some heavy
fighting in which General, afterwards Sir John, Moore and his
brigade highly distinguished themselves, and Moore was twice
wounded. It was a drawn battle; and Brune fell back on the
formidable line of Beverwyk. The duke attacked him on the
6th, and failed to drive him from his position. It became evident
that the allies would not succeed in forcing their way out of the
small district they occupied, and that the hopes entertained in
England of assistance from the Dutch were fallacious, for the
people showed no sign of deserting the French alliance. Accordingly,
on the 18th, the duke capitulated; it was agreed that the
allies should re-embark unmolested and that England should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
restore 8,000 French and Dutch prisoners. The British troops
returned home and the Russians were assigned winter-quarters
in the Channel islands. Dearly as this ill-planned expedition
cost England, both in men and money, the country was consoled
for its failure by the acquisition of the Dutch fleet, which passed
into the king's service in virtue of a convention with the Prince
of Orange. About the same time came news of the surrender
of the rich Dutch colony of Surinam to Admiral Lord Hugh
Seymour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PAUL DESERTS THE COALITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_352" id="TOPIC_352"></a>During the winter the coalition was broken up by the defection
of Russia. Paul was angered by the policy of Austria
which, under Thugut's direction, was dictated by anxiety for the
acquisition of Piedmont; he was irritated by the support Thugut
received from the English government which, so far as the continental
war was concerned, based its hopes on Austrian success,
and he was disgusted by the failure of his arms. He considered
that his troops were sacrificed in Switzerland to Austrian selfishness,
that they were not well treated in the expedition to the
Helder, and, which seems to some extent true, that they were
shabbily provided for in the Channel islands.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> He recalled his
troops and withdrew from the coalition. His political attitude
exhibited "daily tergiversation," the result of palace intrigues.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
The hope of gaining Malta for himself and the knights still
allured him, and on December 31, he assumed the grandmastership
of the order. He kept his fleet in the Mediterranean to
assist in the blockade of Valetta, in the hope of making other
acquisitions, and to support the King of Naples. Yet his unsettled
mind sometimes veered towards France; the "virtues of
Bonaparte" would suddenly become his chief topic of conversation
and "everything would be in suspense" as regards his
policy.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Bonaparte had returned to France, and his return was
to decide the issue of the war on the continent, though that
result could not be foreseen immediately. From the newspapers
sent him by Sidney Smith he learnt in Egypt the news
of the early successes of the Austrians and the distracted state
of France. The government was unpopular, the taxes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
heavy, the revenues fell short of the expenditure, commerce was
destroyed, the royalists were in arms in the north-west, and
brigandage was rife. <a name="TOPIC_353" id="TOPIC_353"></a>He left his army in the charge of Kl&eacute;ber,
embarked on August 23, evaded the British cruisers, and landed
at Fr&eacute;jus on October 9. He joined a party which was plotting
against the directory. On November 9 and 10 (18th and 19th
Brumaire) he overthrew not only the directory, which was ready
to fall, but the legislature also. A provisional government was
set up, and on December 13 a new constitution was published.
Bonaparte was declared first consul for ten years with powers
which, under a thin disguise, made him virtually master of France.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_354" id="TOPIC_354"></a>Kl&eacute;ber found his resources failing, no help came to him,
for England was supreme in the Mediterranean, and the Turks
threatened to attack him. With the assistance of Sidney Smith,
who acted on his own responsibility, he arranged a capitulation
with the grand-vizier. The convention of El Arish, signed on
January 24, 1800, provided that the French should evacuate
Egypt and return home unmolested, and it contained no
stipulation that they should not serve again during the war.
The English ministers, aware that Kl&eacute;ber was in straits, had
already ordered Keith not to agree to any terms short of the
surrender of the French troops as prisoners of war. Keith informed
Smith of this order, but his letter did not reach him
until after the convention was signed. On receiving it, Smith
sent word to Kl&eacute;ber that his government refused to sanction
the convention. When the ministers heard that Smith had
assented to it, they generously resolved not to disavow the act
of a British officer, and ordered that the convention should be
recognised. By that time, however, the French had defeated
the Turks at Heliopolis and were determined to make further
efforts to hold the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BONAPARTE'S LETTER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_355" id="TOPIC_355"></a>Bonaparte lost no time in setting about the pacification of
civil strife in France. In December, 1799, Pitt, untaught by
experience, was planning an expedition to co-operate with the
royalists in La Vend&eacute;e and Brittany, with the object of reducing
Brest, compelling the surrender of the French fleet, which was
to be held in the name of Louis XVIII. (the Count of Provence),
and taking the Spanish fleet as prize. Bonaparte's skilful policy
pacified the disturbed districts, and foiled the hopes of the
royalist conspirators. Pitt was forced to postpone his scheme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
and after a time abandoned it. While he was engaged on it,
Bonaparte sent a letter addressed to the king personally, in
which he declared his desire for peace. In later days he said
that his object was merely to increase his popularity; for the
French were weary of war. In this case he probably spoke the
truth. Be this as it may, he certainly would not have agreed
to such terms as would have given to England and to Europe
the security for which England was fighting. His letter was
answered by Grenville, who said that the king could not enter
into negotiations unless he had a satisfactory assurance that
France would abandon the system of aggression, that while he
did not prescribe the form of government she should adopt,
no assurance would be so satisfactory as the restoration of the
monarchy, and that her present government afforded no evidence
either of a change of system or of stability. George
thought this letter "much too strong," but suggested no alteration.
Talleyrand, then French minister of foreign affairs, wrote
in favour of a negotiation between the two powers, and was told
by Grenville that if the king could see the security of his own
dominions and of Europe assured, he would gladly negotiate
"in concert with his allies". The position taken by the ministers
was sound and honourable, but the tone of their answer to
Bonaparte was unwise, for it played his game by uniting the
French in a determination to resist foreign dictation with respect
to their domestic affairs.</p>

<p>An address to the crown on the French overtures was moved
in the lords by Grenville, and was carried by 92 votes to 6. In
the commons it was supported by George Canning, already one
of the ablest speakers on the government side, and by Pitt who,
in one of his finest speeches, reviewed the relations of France
with other states from 1792 onwards, as proving that the proposed
negotiations would have been illusory; he urged that the
exhausted state of France held out hope of a permanent peace,
and declared that as a lover of peace he would not sacrifice it by
grasping at a shadow. The address was opposed by Fox, who
returned to parliament for the occasion. He effectively ridiculed
Pitt's oft-repeated assurances that France was exhausted; but
his main contention, that if France as a republic had been aggressive,
so she had been when under Louis XIV., that she had
not acted worse than the allies of Great Britain, and that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
was therefore no reason to refuse to negotiate with her, seems
academic and feeble. The opposition mustered in full strength,
but was defeated by 265 to 64. The divisions prove that the
position of the government was unimpaired in parliament.</p>

<p>In the country generally the patriotic spirit aroused by the
military aggressions of France and the achievements of the
British navy was strong, and revolutionary principles were
seldom publicly professed. Some abortive projects of Irish
conspirators in 1798 for co-operating with the corresponding
society led to the appointment of a committee of the commons,
which reported on the revolutionary societies in March, 1799.
Bills were passed for suppressing these societies and restricting
debating societies, and for compelling printers to obtain certificates
and to affix their names to all matter that they printed.
In evident connexion with these measures was the law against
combinations of workmen enacted in this, and amended in the
next session, to which reference has already been made (p. <a href="#Page_277">277</a>);
though probably political in intention, it had an oppressive effect
on the condition of the working classes. Only three trials for
sedition took place during the year, one of them of the printer
and publisher, and another of the author of the same libel, a
pamphlet by Gilbert Wakefield in answer to one on the government
side. Wakefield, who had taken deacon's orders and
afterwards left the Church, was a distinguished scholar and
a friend of Fox. He was prosecuted by Scott, the attorney-general,
and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and to find
sureties for his future behaviour. The severity of the sentence
excited the indignation of the opposition, and &pound;5,000 was subscribed
for him. In July Scott was appointed chief-justice of
the common pleas, and received a peerage as Lord Eldon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INCOME TAX.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_356" id="TOPIC_356"></a>The burdens of the country were increasing. In December,
1798, Pitt announced that the supplies exceeded the ordinary
revenue by &pound;23,000,000. He repeated the principle which he
enunciated when proposing the triple assessment, that loans
should not exceed such amount as could be defrayed within a
limited time by temporary taxation. The triple assessment had
failed, though the deficiency had been supplied by voluntary
contributions. He proposed to substitute an income tax of 2s.
in the pound on all incomes of and above &pound;200, and of graduated
amounts between &pound;60 and &pound;200. The produce, he calcu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>lated,
would be at least &pound;10,000,000 a year. The opposition,
led by Tierney, objected to the tax as inquisitorial, as a grievous
confiscation, and as unjust, in that it would fall equally on precarious
and on settled incomes, on the produce of industry and
on the wealth of the idle. It was carried in the lords without a
division, and in the commons by a large majority, and came
into operation on April 5, 1799. During the year 1799 Pitt
raised &pound;15,000,000 by loan, including &pound;3,000,000 for Ireland,
charging the income tax with the interest and redemption of
&pound;11,000,000. The loan was raised in the 3 per cents; it created
&pound;175 debt for each &pound;100 money, and the rate was therefore
5&frac14; per cent. In his next budget, for 1800, Pitt reported the
supplies for the year at &pound;39,500,000. The produce of the
income tax for the first year was disappointing, and for the
coming year he reckoned it only at &pound;7,000,000. In return for
a renewal of its charter the bank of England granted a loan
of &pound;3,000,000, without interest, for six years, and Pitt further
borrowed &pound;20,500,000, including &pound;2,000,000 for Ireland. The
income tax was charged with &pound;13,500,000 of the British loan,
and additions were made to the taxes on tea and spirits.
Public credit was good and commerce and manufactures rapidly
increasing, and Pitt obtained the loan at an average rate of not
quite 4&frac34; per cent.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_357" id="TOPIC_357"></a>But while commerce was flourishing the poor were suffering
terribly from scarcity. The spring and summer of 1799 were
cold and wet, and the harvest was wretched. During the twelve
months which succeeded September 1, 1799, the average price of
wheat rose to 106s. a quarter. Parliament held several debates
on the scarcity. Whitbread for the second time brought in a
bill for the regulation of the wages of agricultural labourers;
Pitt opposed it on sound economic grounds and it was again
rejected. During the spring of 1800 parliament made some proposals
for the husbanding of wheat and for bounties on importation,
but, as we shall see later, the scarcity grew more grievous.
The distress of the poor and the burden of taxation strengthened
the desire for peace, and a large meeting of London citizens
petitioned parliament for negotiations with France. In May the
king was shot at in Drury Lane theatre. The incident had no
political significance; his assailant, Hadfield, a discharged soldier,
was insane and was sent to Bedlam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_358" id="TOPIC_358"></a>At the beginning of 1800 Pitt's hopes were mainly founded
on his scheme of co-operation with the French royalists, which
was rendered abortive by Bonaparte's measures of pacification,
and on the arms of Austria. Thugut knew that from Bonaparte
the emperor could not expect to gain better terms than those of
the treaty of Campo Formio, and held that the best chance
of forwarding Austrian interests lay in prosecuting the war in
alliance with England. Austria, however, could not move without
English money. The English government promised a loan
of &pound;2,000,000 and made subsidiary treaties with the Elector of
Bavaria, the Duke of W&uuml;rtemberg, and the Elector of Mainz
for contingents to serve with the Austrian armies. In April the
Austrians under Melas defeated the French in the mountain
passes to the west of Genoa, shut up the left wing of their
army within the lines of Genoa, and forced the right wing
under Suchet across the Var. Their advance was stayed by
Mass&eacute;na's defence of Genoa. His troops suffered terribly from
famine; they were shut in on land by the Austrians and bombarded
from the sea by British ships. Meanwhile Bonaparte
was preparing to attack the Austrians in northern Italy as soon
as their chief army in the Black Forest country under Kray
was effectually held in check by the French army of the Rhine,
so as to enable the French to use the Swiss passes. If Mass&eacute;na
could detain the Austrians before Genoa until Bonaparte descended
into Italy, they might then be taken in the rear. A
promise had been made that a British force would co-operate
with the Austrians and excite the royalists of southern France
to insurrection. If such a force had landed on the rear of the
French, Suchet's corps must have been destroyed, Genoa would
probably have fallen, and the campaign might have had a
different event. But the ministers failed to see the supreme
importance of supporting the Austrians. They hesitated, and
withdrew troops which should have been sent to Minorca to
form an army to co-operate with Melas, in order to employ
them in Portugal. There, however, they were not wanted, for
Portugal was not attacked. The great opportunity was lost.
Sir Ralph Abercromby with 5,000 men sailed from Minorca
for Genoa on June 22, but then it was too late.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF MARENGO.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_359" id="TOPIC_359"></a>In April Moreau defeated Kray in a series of engagements
and forced him to retire to Ulm. Bonaparte, who had formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
"an army of reserve" at Dijon, crossed the Great St. Bernard in
May with 41,000 men, reached Aosta on the 22nd, and entered
Milan on June 2. On the 4th Mass&eacute;na capitulated, and led his
half-starved force out of Genoa with the honours of war. It
had done its work by keeping the Austrians before the city.
The successes of Moreau secured Switzerland and enabled Bonaparte
to summon other French divisions, partly composed of
detachments from Moreau's army, to enter Italy by the passes
of the Simplon and the St. Gothard. Their appearance upset
the plans which Melas was making for defence. He met
Bonaparte at Marengo on the 14th, and after a hard-fought
battle was totally defeated. On the 16th he signed a convention
at Alessandria, which left the French masters of the
country as far as the Oglio. Hostilities in Germany were suspended
on July 9. Bonaparte returned to Paris in triumph after
an absence of less than two months. On June 20, before the
news of Marengo reached Vienna, Minto signed a convention
with Austria which guaranteed the loan to the emperor, and
stipulated that neither power should make peace without the
consent of the other. Pitt's hopes were defeated; for the time
Austria was completely paralysed. The opposition reproached
the government with the failure of its plans. The country, it
was urged, desired peace; another defeat would reduce Austria
to impotence, and France, disengaged from all continental war,
would direct her whole strength against England. Parliament
remained steadfast in its support of the government.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, anxious to detach Austria from her alliance with
England, offered peace to the emperor, who sent an envoy to
Paris to find out what terms he proposed. It was a dangerous
move, for the English ministers might have interpreted the
mission as a negotiation for a separate peace, contrary to the
convention of June 20; and Thugut feared that England might
take offence and leave Austria to Bonaparte's mercy. The
emperor's envoy was in fact persuaded by Talleyrand to sign
articles of peace, generally on the basis of the treaty of Campo
Formio. The emperor disavowed his unauthorised action.
Austria's interests would be best served by a general peace,
arranged at a European congress, at which Great Britain should
be represented. This was in accordance with the views of the
British government, and on August 9 Minto informed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
emperor that his court desired to take part in negotiations for a
general peace. The emperor proposed a congress at Lun&eacute;ville in
which England should be invited to take part. Bonaparte's design
of disuniting Austria from England and treating separately
with the emperor was foiled; he could not reject the emperor's
proposal, for France was eager for peace. Pitt and Grenville
believed that negotiations were certain, and Thomas Grenville
was chosen to attend the congress.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_360" id="TOPIC_360"></a>But Bonaparte's diplomatic resources were not exhausted.
He declared that if the continental armistice with Austria was
to be prolonged, it must be supplemented by a naval armistice
with Great Britain, and in September he employed an agent
named Otto to negotiate this armistice and to propose a separate
peace between France and England. Bonaparte's project would
have enabled France to revictual Malta and to send supplies
and reinforcements to her army in Egypt, and would thus have
robbed England of the most powerful means of enforcing her
demands in the proposed congress. The king was for rejecting
the project absolutely. The cabinet was divided: Dundas and
some others were for making a separate peace; Pitt and Grenville
were determined to maintain the alliance with Austria, to insist
that all negotiations should be for a general peace, and to refuse
to throw away the advantages which England derived from her
naval supremacy, but, as a speedy termination of the armistice
would have been fatal to Austria, they hoped to modify Bonaparte's
demands. Pitt, of course, had his way, and the government,
after sending Bonaparte a counter-project which he
refused, finally rejected his proposal. Bonaparte was enraged
and stormed against England's usurpation of the lordship of
the sea. Determined to isolate her, he pressed the emperor's
ministers to negotiate separately. They foresaw that they might
be forced to yield, but so long as they were not assured of advantageous
terms, decided to remain united to England; for
they were unwilling to stand alone, to lose the money of England,
or to risk a possible alliance between England and Prussia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AUSTRIAN POWER CRUSHED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_361" id="TOPIC_361"></a>While the proposed naval armistice was still in debate, the
blockade of Valetta came to an end. England's supremacy in the
Mediterranean prevented France from relieving the garrison. The
only two ships which remained to France of the fleet defeated
in Abukir bay were captured, one of them by Nelson himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
The blockade was kept up until September 15, when the place
was surrendered after a siege of two years, and Malta passed
into the possession of Great Britain. About the same time the
Dutch island of Cura&ccedil;ao put itself under the king's protection.
Earlier in the year Goree was surrendered to a British squadron.
Elsewhere British ships were less profitably employed. Some
attacks on the Breton coast did little damage to the enemy, and
brought no material advantage to England. The government
employed the troops which should have been sent in the spring
to the support of the Austrians in desultory expeditions. In
August a considerable force under Sir James Pulteney was sent
against Ferrol. After landing his men Pulteney found that the
place was too strong to be taken by a <i>coup-de-main</i>, and abandoned
the enterprise. An equally abortive attempt was made
on Cadiz in October by a force of 22,000 men under Abercromby,
then commanding at Minorca, and by the Mediterranean
fleet under Keith. The plague was raging in the town, and
Keith could not guarantee that, if the troops were landed, the
weather might not cut them off from communication with the
fleet, and possibly hinder re-embarkation. Abercromby therefore
refused to land his troops, and decided to sail off to Gibraltar.
He received orders to attack the French in Egypt in
co-operation with the grand-vizier. The troops landed in
Abukir bay on February 8 and 9, 1801, with results which
must be deferred to our next volume.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_362" id="TOPIC_362"></a>The armistice in Germany ended on November 28. A strong
Austrian army under the archduke John, a general of no experience,
held the line of the Inn. The archduke adopted the
offensive, crossed the river, attacked the French under Moreau
at Hohenlinden on December 3, and was totally defeated, losing
ninety-seven guns and 15,000 men, or more, killed, wounded,
or prisoners. The Austrians were utterly crushed; the French
crossed the Inn and the Salzach without meeting serious opposition.
The archduke Charles again took command of the
defeated army, and on the 25th signed an armistice at Steyer.
Meanwhile Cobenzl, the imperial ambassador, was haggling
over terms of peace with Joseph Bonaparte at Lun&eacute;ville; he
refused to negotiate officially without the participation of England,
and at last proposed that if a treaty was made, it should
not be announced until after March 10 when the Anglo-Austrian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
alliance would lapse. The battle of Hohenlinden brought the
alliance to a premature end. The emperor informed the British
court that he was no longer able to maintain the alliance, and
gave Cobenzl authority to sign preliminaries independently of
Great Britain. The splendid achievement of Macdonald, who
led the "second army of reserve" from the Grisons across the
Spl&uuml;gen, and the subsequent success of the French under Brune,
who forced the passage of the Mincio and crossed the Adige,
enabled Bonaparte to dictate his own terms to Austria. By the
treaty of Lun&eacute;ville, signed on February 9, 1801, Belgium and
the left bank of the Rhine were ceded to France, and the line
of the Adige was made the Austrian boundary in Italy; the
grand-duchy of Tuscany was to be transferred to the house of
Parma, and Modena annexed to the Cisalpine republic, and
the independence of the Batavian, Helvetian, Cisalpine, and
Ligurian republics was acknowledged by Austria; they remained
practically under French domination.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_363" id="TOPIC_363"></a>In addition to the loss of her ally, new dangers threatened
England in the later part of the year. They arose from the
animosity of the tsar. He was angered by England's alliance
with Austria, and by the certainty that his hostile attitude would
prevent her from handing over Malta to him; for though the
government would have ceded the island to him as grand-master
of the knights, if he had continued to co-operate with England,
it was not bound to do so by treaty, and would not cede it to a
sovereign who was fast becoming an open enemy. Paul was
greatly enraged, and on February 1, 1800, wrote to Vorontsov,
his minister in England, desiring that Whitworth (created Lord
Whitworth in March) should be recalled, as he did not want
"liars as ministers at his court".<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> He refused a passport to
Whitworth's messenger in March, and behaved, Whitworth
wrote, in the way which showed that he was "literally not in
his senses".<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> At last, apparently on April 1, he demanded
Whitworth's recall.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> After long delay Whitworth obtained a
passport and returned to England, leaving the embassy to a
<i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>, who was peremptorily dismissed by Paul, and
left Russia with the embassy in June. Bonaparte was quick to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
take advantage of Paul's anger against England. After some
overtures to him, begun as early as March,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> he proposed in July
to restore to him 6,000, and, later, a larger number of Russian
prisoners taken in Holland and Switzerland, and suggested ceding
to him Malta, which was then hard pressed by the British
fleet. Paul was delighted, and made arrangements for garrisoning
Valetta; but the place was surrendered to Great Britain, and
the British government would not part with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ARMED NEUTRALITY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_364" id="TOPIC_364"></a>Paul had already laid his hand on the weapon forged by
his mother Catherine in 1780, an armed neutrality of the Baltic
powers. The war put many difficulties in the way of neutral
commerce. England's maritime supremacy gave the trade of
Europe into her hands. For her own purposes she encouraged
neutral trade with herself to the great profit of those who engaged
in it, but she placed rigorous restrictions on the trade of
neutrals with her enemy. France, in a more lawless fashion, had
attempted to destroy neutral trade with England, but had only
succeeded in driving the ships of neutral states from her own
ports.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> England could enforce her system in every sea. She
refused to allow that an enemy's goods were covered by a
neutral flag, and insisted that naval stores were contraband of
war, and that no trade should be carried on with a port of
which she declared a blockade. In 1798 Sweden and Denmark
adopted the plan of sending their merchant ships under convoy
to exempt them from search. Paul saw his opportunity in the
annoyance which the British system caused to neutral states, and
in May and June, 1800, invited Sweden and Denmark to resist
it. In July a Danish frigate, the <i>Freya</i>, with a convoy was
stopped by British ships in the Channel; her captain refused
to allow the ships under his convoy to be searched, and after
a short resistance the <i>Freya</i> was captured and taken into the
Downs. The government despatched Whitworth to Copenhagen
to remonstrate on this act of war on the part of Denmark,
and enforced his representations by sending a squadron
into the Sound.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_365" id="TOPIC_365"></a>Christian VII. gave way, and promised to send no more
convoys until the question was decided by treaty. He complained
to Russia, and Paul in November laid an embargo on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
all British ships, imprisoned the crews of those in his ports,
and seized British merchandise. He further invited Denmark,
Sweden, and Prussia to form an alliance for the protection of
their flags on the basis of insisting that the neutral flag should
cover an enemy's goods, not being contraband of war, that contraband
should not include naval stores, and that if a declaration
of blockade was to be respected, the blockade must be effectual,
and that ships convoyed by a man-of-war belonging to their
sovereign should be exempt from search by a belligerent on a
declaration by the captain of the convoying ship that they were
not carrying contraband goods. This move was highly gratifying
to Bonaparte, for it struck at England's naval and commercial
ascendency, and a treaty which he concluded with the
United States in September contained provisions of a like kind.
Frederick William III. of Prussia, seeing that Austria was at its
last gasp, was anxious to please him, for he hoped to gain some
advantage from him in Germany, and specially coveted the
possession of Hanover. He complained that a Prussian ship,
laden with timber and bound for Amsterdam, had been seized
by a British cruiser and taken into Cuxhaven, a port belonging
to the state of Hamburg, and he ordered his troops to occupy
Cuxhaven, a measure which threatened George's electoral dominions.
That would not in itself have concerned England, but
Cuxhaven was at the mouth of the Elbe, the principal route by
which British commerce was carried on with central Europe.
In the existing state of affairs it was not advisable to give the
Prussian king a cause of grievance. The government, therefore,
directed the restoration of the ship in the hope of pacifying
him, but he nevertheless persisted in the occupation of the
port. On December 16 the maritime confederacy was signed
by Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, and on the 18th by Prussia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND TO BE HUMBLED.</i></div>

<p>In January, 1801, Paul sent an ambassador to Paris to
arrange a treaty of alliance. Bonaparte's hopes seemed likely
to be more than fulfilled. An attempt made on his life on
December 24, which many Frenchmen absurdly believed to
have been abetted by the English government, gave him the
opportunity of crushing his domestic foes. England, the object
of his passionate hatred, was bereft of her Austrian ally; he
was pressing Spain to invade Portugal unless she would close
her ports against English ships; the northern powers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
striking at England's maritime lordship; her navy would be
deprived of stores, and her people of foreign wheat. An alliance
with Russia would enable France to become dominant in central
Europe, to overthrow the British supremacy in the Mediterranean,
and to preserve her hold on Egypt. Soon every
state would shut its ports against British ships, and England's
sea-power would be overthrown by the power of France on
land. Paul held out yet greater hopes; he would undertake
a joint invasion of India and drive the British from the east.
Though his wild schemes did not meet with Bonaparte's approval,
Paul set an army in motion for the conquest of India.
Yet neither the government nor the people of England was
dismayed by the isolation of their country nor the number of
their foes. Nor had they cause. Bonaparte, great general as
he was, could not understand the nature of England's strength,
and was indeed profoundly ignorant of all that concerned maritime
power and commerce. The British navy was in admirable
condition, both as regards material and men; it was blockading
the Dutch in the Texel, and the ships of France and Spain in
every port in which they lay from Toulon to Flushing, and the
thunder of its guns was soon to be heard in the north. In India
Lord Wellesley had not only crushed resistance and added a
vast territory to the company's possessions, but was establishing
the British rule on a firm basis, and there, too, British ships
would have to be reckoned with. On January 14 the government
placed an embargo on the ships of Russia, Sweden, and
Denmark. Orders were sent for the capture of the Danish
colonies in the West Indies, and a fleet was prepared to sail for
the Baltic under Sir Hyde Parker, and with Nelson as second
in command.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_366" id="TOPIC_366"></a>Yet, though undismayed by her foes, England was sorely
dismayed by the sufferings of her poor. Peace was very needful
for her. Wealth indeed was rapidly increasing; her foreign
trade which in 1792 was &pound;44,500,000 in value had risen to over
&pound;73,750,000. But the poor lacked bread. The increase in the
manufacturing population caused an increased demand for food,
and England depended on supplies of cereals from abroad.
The war restricted the importation of corn and sent up its price.
The hopes fixed on the harvest of 1800 were disappointed; the
stock of the previous year was exhausted, and wheat rose to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
the famine price of 120s. a quarter. Bread riots were raised in
various places, and were in some cases due to a belief, existing
even among persons of education, that the high price of corn
was largely caused by the dealers. Some dealers were prosecuted
under the old statutes against "forestalling and regrating,"
and when one named Rusby, charged with buying oats at
41s. a quarter and selling them again in the same market at
44s., was found guilty, Lord Kenyon congratulated the jury on
the benefit which their verdict conferred on the country. On
appeal his law was questioned and the proceedings dropped.
The future looked even darker than the present, for the Russian
embargo cut off a main source of supply. The desire for peace
was general. Pitt, whose health was giving way, was full of
anxiety, for the scarcity seemed likely to embarrass the government
in its efforts to maintain the honour of England, and
might even compel the country to assent to a peace alike disadvantageous
and fallacious. "The question of peace or war,"
he wrote in October, "is not in itself so formidable as that of
the scarcity with which it is combined".</p>

<p>He determined on an early meeting of parliament, believing
that some relief might be afforded by legislation, and that, at
the least, it would quiet the public mind and check the rise of
disaffection. Besides measures for the encouragement of home
agriculture, which would necessarily operate slowly, he planned
others to meet the immediate crisis, for though as a disciple of
Adam Smith he disliked interference with the regular course of
trade, he considered that the situation of the country rendered
some regulation necessary. Grenville differed from him. He
held closely to the maxims of political economy, and though he
did not oppose him in the cabinet, he urged on Pitt in private
that all interference with the process by which supply and
demand counteracted each other must be harmful. Pitt held
to his own opinion. Parliament met on November 11. The
king's speech invited it to consider means by which agriculture
might be extended, and, for the present, the best means of
stimulating the importation of grain and promoting frugality in
using it, and checked the foolish and mischievous outcry against
the dealers by pointing out that the ordinary practices of buying
and selling were necessary in the existing state of society.
Acting on the reports of committees, parliament granted boun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>ties
on the importation of corn and rice, and prohibited the use
of corn in distillery and the manufacture of starch, the exportation
of provisions, the making of bread solely from fine flour,
and the sale of bread within twenty-four hours of its baking.
The opposition reproached the government, and especially Pitt,
with having caused the scarcity by the rejection of Bonaparte's
proposals for peace; but motions for an inquiry into the state of
the nation, for immediate negotiations with France, and for the
dismissal of the ministers received scarcely any support. It
was not from parliament that Pitt's ministry was to receive its
death-blow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IRISH UNION DESIRABLE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_367" id="TOPIC_367"></a>Almost as soon as the Irish rebellion was quelled, the project
of a legislative union with Great Britain was publicly discussed.
Such a union existed from 1654 to the restoration
in 1660. At the time of the union with Scotland, in 1703 and
1707, the Irish parliament proposed a union, and its wish was
disregarded. Since then various writers on politics had recommended
it, chiefly as a means of giving Ireland freedom of trade.
The improvement in the material condition of the country
which began in the fourth decade of the century strengthened
the spirit of nationality, the Irish interest became dominant in
politics, religious animosity decreased, and during the American
war Ireland, instead of looking to a union as a means of attaining
prosperity, found herself in a position to demand the concessions
she desired. The abolition of restrictions on her trade
in 1779-80 removed the chief motive which had impelled Scotland
towards union; the grant of legislative independence fostered
the national pride. The constitution of 1782 left Ireland connected
with Great Britain only by the unity of the executive in
both countries. The Irish parliament might have expressed disapproval
of a war or alliance entered on by Great Britain and
might have refused supplies; it might have imposed excessive
duties on English goods, might have refused a commercial compact
with Great Britain, and did so in 1785; it might have
taken a different course from the British parliament on a constitutional
question, and did so on the regency question in 1789.
The empire was weakened by lack of union. English statesmen,
and above all Pitt, saw that the tie, precarious in quiet times,
might break under some stress, and desired to strengthen it by
an incorporate union, and the king heartily agreed with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_368" id="TOPIC_368"></a>For Ireland a union afforded the only chance of tranquillity,
for catholic emancipation could not safely be granted without it.
Since the extension of the suffrage to Roman catholics in 1793,
emancipation unaccompanied by union would have placed the
government of the country in the hands of a popish democracy;
for the catholics outnumbered the protestants by three to one,
and the act of 1793 established little short of manhood suffrage.
A catholic parliament would have made Ireland no place for
protestants, and would have provoked a civil war, in which, unlike
the late rebellion, England would probably have had almost the
whole catholic population arrayed against her. With a united
parliament the catholics might enjoy equal privileges with their
protestant neighbours, and would be powerless to oppress them.
The war with France revealed the dangers of the existing
system; the rebellion left the two religious parties at deadly
feud; the protestants feared catholic vengeance, the catholics
held the protestant ascendency in deeper hatred since the rise
of Orangeism and the barbarities of '98. The time seemed
ripe for the fulfilment of Pitt's long-cherished hope of union.
He desired to do the catholics justice and intended that the
union should provide for emancipation, a provision for their
priesthood, to be accompanied by an increase of the <i>regium
donum</i>, the endowment granted by William III. for the support
of the Irish presbyterian ministers, and the commutation of
tithe; and this comprehensive scheme was warmly approved by
Cornwallis. But the principal men of the government party in
Ireland were strongly opposed to the admission of catholics into
the united parliament, and in October, 1798, Clare convinced
Pitt that the proposal would wreck the chances of union. Pitt
therefore dissociated emancipation from union, adopted a scheme
of union on a protestant basis, and left the settlement of the just
claims of the catholics, which was necessary to the successful
working of a union, to be effected later.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CATHOLIC SUPPORT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_369" id="TOPIC_369"></a>The intended union was announced and advocated in a
pamphlet by Cooke, the Irish under-secretary. The protestants
generally were hostile to the scheme, some from feelings of
national pride, others from dislike to the threatened overthrow
of the political ascendency of their party. Catholic support
might be gained if there was reason to expect that union would
be followed by emancipation, a provision for the clergy, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
would entail a royal power of veto over episcopal appointments,
and the commutation of tithe. Dublin was strongly against a
measure which would injure its position as a capital; and the
lawyers, who would also lose by it, were formidable opponents.
In preparation for the coming struggle the government informed
the catholic bishops that, though emancipation could not be
included in the measure, they were anxious to make provision
for their clergy; a few anti-unionist officials resigned or were
dismissed, and the demands of some of the government party,
who, as usual, clamoured to be rewarded beforehand, appeared
to have been satisfied. The king's speech at the opening of the
Irish parliament on January 22, 1799, though not mentioning
union, recommended some effectual means of strengthening the
connexion. The address was carried in the lords by 52 votes
to 17. In the commons it was moved by Lord Castlereagh, the
chief secretary, and was strongly opposed by Plunket, Ponsonby,
and others. After a debate which lasted from 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
the next day, the government had a majority of only one, and
in a subsequent division was in a minority of 5. On the 31st
Pitt, in an eloquent speech, moved resolutions for a union in
the British house of commons. Sheridan, Grey, and Burke's
friend, Laurence, fought hard against them, but were in a
minority which varied from 45 to 15. In the lords they were
agreed to without a division, and in April both houses adopted
an address in favour of union.</p>

<p>The failure of the government in the Irish parliament was
hailed with delight and rioting in Dublin. The prospects of the
union soon began to brighten. The cabinet made it clear that
the measure would not be abandoned. As it seemed likely
that the protestants would offer the catholics emancipation in
order to induce them to combine against union, Cornwallis was
authorised to declare that the government would resist to the
utmost any concession to the catholics so long as a separate parliament
existed. No definite promise was made to the catholics,
but their hopes were excited. In the autumn, Castlereagh,
who came over for the purpose, represented to the cabinet the
importance of gaining their support; he was told to inform
Cornwallis that the cabinet was favourable to emancipation, and
that without giving the catholics "any direct assurance," he might
safely solicit their support. This he did with general success;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
and the catholic bishops and many of their clergy, allured by
the prospect of a provision from government, were active on the
unionist side. The unionist party was further strengthened by
the state of the country. Many districts were infested by bands
of men, survivals of the rebel armies, who murdered, robbed,
and intimidated their neighbours, and mutilated cattle. A fresh
outbreak of rebellion seemed likely in the spring; the large
British force already in Ireland was augmented, and an act
was passed giving the lord-lieutenant power to authorise the
capital or other punishment of those convicted by court-martial
of rebellion or attacks on the king's subjects. The opinion that
Ireland needed a new system of government gained ground.
Yet the feeling against union remained overwhelmingly general,
specially among the protestants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A MAJORITY SECURED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_370" id="TOPIC_370"></a>A majority in parliament had to be gained by the ministers.
The county members, who were independent, for the most part
were, and remained, anti-unionists. The preponderance of power
lay with the 236 members for the 118 boroughs, of which only
eight were free from all patronage. Nearly all the remainder
belonged to borough-owners and were regarded as their personal
property. A large number of them would be disfranchised
by a union. Not to compensate the owners would have been
contrary to the general moral standard of the age when uninfluenced
by party feelings, and would have made union impossible.
As Pitt in his reform bill of 1785 proposed to buy
up the patronage of the English close boroughs, so the government
determined to compensate those Irish borough-owners
whose boroughs were to lose both members. The price of each
borough was eventually fixed at &pound;15,000, the market value, and
as eighty-four were disfranchised, the sum paid for them was
&pound;1,260,000. This was not bribery; it was an open transaction,
and the money was paid alike to opponents and supporters of
the union. The services of great men were secured by peerages
and other dignities. During and at the end of the struggle
twenty new Irish peerages were created, sixteen peers were
promoted, and five received English peerages. Most of these
grants were mere bribes, and so too were the many places and
pensions which helped to swell the unionist party in parliament.
Some money, though the amount must have been small, was
probably also spent in bribery. The government would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
risk a general election; the union was to be carried by the
existing parliament. Gradually sixty-three vacancies were
created in the commons, some by death, some by acceptance
of office, most of them doubtless by the resignation of members
who would not follow their patrons by becoming unionists, and
others, probably, through the purchase of seats by the government
from sitting members. The vacancies were eventually
filled by supporters of the union. While, then, the extent of
the corruption practised by the government has been exaggerated,
the union was undoubtedly carried by corrupt means.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Pitt did not corrupt the Irish parliament; it
was corrupt already: he merely continued the immemorial
methods of dealing with it on a larger scale than before. Nobles
and gentry chose to sell themselves, and, in order to rid Ireland
of a source of trouble and danger, and Great Britain of a cause
of weakness, he paid them their price. Cornwallis murmured
at having to negotiate and job with "the most corrupt people
under heaven"; but he did his share of the work. Castlereagh,
personally not less honourable, who had much of it to do, did it
without compunction, for it was, he said, "to buy out and secure
to the crown for ever the fee-simple of Irish corruption, which
has so long enfeebled the powers of the government and endangered
the connection". It was essential to the welfare both
of Great Britain and Ireland that the union should be effected,
and that it should be effected without delay; and it could not
have been effected by any other means than those which Pitt
adopted. It was better by giving these greedy politicians their
price to put an end to a system maintained by perpetual corruption,
worked in the interests of an ascendant minority, distrusted
by the mass of the people, incapable of affording the
country the blessings of domestic peace, and dangerous to the
security of the empire.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_371" id="TOPIC_371"></a>The Irish parliament began its last session on January 15,
1800, and the address was hotly debated. Grattan, who had not
appeared there since 1797, spoke with extraordinary eloquence
in support of an amendment on the side of legislative independence.
Though the vacant seats were not nearly all filled up, the
amendment was rejected by 138 votes to 96. The anti-unionists
were furious; they raised a fund of &pound;100,000, paid or promised,
for the purpose of out-buying the ministers, bought some seats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
and paid and offered bribes. The catholics, the yeomanry, and
the Orangemen were urged to combine to withstand the union.
Some rioting took place in Dublin, but there was no serious outbreak;
for the Orange grand lodge kept the society quiet, and
the mass of the people, except when excited by agitation, regarded
the question with indifference. A fierce struggle ensued
in parliament, and it was not until March 28 that the articles of
union were carried and sent to England. They were debated at
some length in both houses of the English parliament, but were
carried by large majorities. They were next presented in the
Irish parliament in the form of a bill. It was vehemently opposed.
In the debate on the commitment, on May 26, Grattan
delivered an oration against it, splendid in diction and inflammatory
in tone, and was answered by Castlereagh who spoke,
as indeed he spoke throughout these debates, with conspicuous
dignity and moderation. The majority for committing the bill
was 118 to 73. It was then passed by the English parliament
and received the royal assent on August 1. A new great seal
and a new royal standard were made for the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland, and on January 1, 1801, the
king's new title was proclaimed, from which the words "King
of France," retained since the time of Edward III., were omitted.</p>

<p>By the act of union Ireland was to be represented in the united
parliament, in the upper house by four spiritual lords sitting in
rotation and twenty-eight temporal lords elected for life by the
Irish peerage, and in the lower by 100 members.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The right of
the crown to create fresh Irish peerages was restricted. The
established Church of Ireland was declared one with the Church
of England, and the preservation of the united Church of England
and Ireland was to be "an essential and fundamental part
of the union". Commercial interests were mainly settled in
accordance with the proposals of 1785, and some Irish manufactures
were temporarily protected from suffering by British
competition. The debts of the two countries were to be kept
separate for twenty years, or until they should be to each other
in the same proportion as the respective contributions of the two
countries; and until their amalgamation the annual contribution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
of Great Britain towards the expenditure of the United Kingdom
was fixed at fifteen parts and of Ireland at two parts. The first
session of the united parliament was opened on January 22,
1801, the members for Great Britain being the same as those of
the previous parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CATHOLIC QUESTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_372" id="TOPIC_372"></a>The Irish catholics could have prevented the union. They
made it possible, some by giving active help, others by maintaining
neutrality; and though no definite promise had been
made to them, they were led to expect that union would be
followed by emancipation, a provision for their clergy, and the
commutation of tithe. Pitt recognised this, and further held
that his work would be incomplete without these healing measures,
which would give "full effect to the great object of the
union&mdash;that of tranquillising Ireland and attaching it to this
country". Accordingly, in September, 1800, as soon as the
union was effected, he called a meeting of the cabinet to consider
these questions. He said nothing to the king on the subject,
thinking, doubtless, that it would be less difficult to gain
his consent if a complete plan was presented to him as the
policy adopted by the cabinet. The risk was great, for in 1795
George, as we have seen, held that to consent to emancipation
would be a breach of his coronation oath, and so lately as the
autumn of 1799 he told Dundas that he hoped the government
was "not pledged to anything in favour of the Roman
catholics". Loughborough, the chancellor, saw an opportunity
for ingratiating himself by betraying the prime minister. When
he received Pitt's letter summoning him to the cabinet meeting
on the catholic question, he was with the king at Weymouth,
where George often resided in the summer since his recovery
in 1789. He showed the king Pitt's letter, excited him against
emancipation, and furnished him with arguments. Lord Auckland,
the postmaster-general, who was allied with the chief Irish
anti-catholics, was his cousin, and, probably at Auckland's suggestion,
the Archbishops of Canterbury and Armagh wrote to
the king to strengthen him against emancipation. When the
cabinet met, Loughborough agreed to the commutation of tithe,
but objected to any further concession, and the matter was
adjourned.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_373" id="TOPIC_373"></a>Pitt again brought it before the cabinet in January, 1801.
The king's feelings were then generally known, and the Duke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
of Portland and Lords Westmorland and Liverpool more or
less decidedly joined Loughborough in opposing emancipation.
On the 28th George attacked Dundas on the subject at a levee:
"I shall," he said, "reckon any man my personal enemy who
proposes such a measure". He requested Addington, the
speaker, to remonstrate with Pitt. On the 31st Pitt wrote him
a long letter setting forth the general grounds of his desire for
emancipation, by the substitution of a political oath for the
sacramental test, and for a provision for the catholic clergy,
adding that if the king refused his consent, he must resign
office. George, after taking counsel with Addington, replied
that he was bound by his coronation oath to refuse his consent,
and proposed that both he and Pitt should say no more on the
subject. In answer Pitt wrote on February 3 that he must
resign office as soon as a new ministry could be formed.
George, who was incapable of appreciating his splendid services,
and showed later that he must often have chafed under his control,
invited Addington, a dull man after his own heart, to form
a ministry. He consented, and on the 5th the king accepted
Pitt's resignation. Dundas, Grenville, Spencer, and Windham
decided to go out with Pitt, so did Canning and others who
held minor offices, and Cornwallis and Castlereagh also retired.
Pitt promised his help to Addington, whose father had physicked
the Pitt family, and persuaded some of his followers to
join the new ministry. As it was to be an anti-catholic ministry,
his conduct has been held to prove that he was paving his way
to a return to office, and that the change, so far as he was concerned,
was, to use Fox's expression, "a juggle". It should be
remembered that the country was engaged in a deadly conflict,
and that its safety was always Pitt's first consideration. Emancipation
was hopeless. He had felt bound in honour to break
up a strong ministry because he could not carry it, and it was
his duty to do what he could to strengthen the new ministry so
long as it did not prove incapable of guiding the country in
critical times.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S IMPENDING RESIGNATION.</i></div>

<p>In this, as in every part of these transactions, his conduct
was honourable and straightforward. He would not continue
in office when thwarted by the king on a question of great importance,
nor would he consent to disappoint hopes which he
had encouraged and by which he had benefited. That he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
influenced by any other motive, such as that his continuance in
office would hinder peace, is a vain imagining. He has been
blamed by an eminent historian for not having persevered in
his attempt to overcome the king's determination, which on
other occasions had yielded to pressure.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> On none of these
occasions had George's religious convictions been concerned.
Some experience of the power exercised by religious prejudice
in strengthening the resistance which a naturally obstinate person
can make to reason, persuasion, and the force of circumstances,
leads me to believe that Pitt was right in accepting the
king's decision as final and in not engaging in a struggle which
might, especially at that time, have had disastrous consequences.
Short of such a struggle he did insist on his policy in the only
way open to him; he resigned. Where he was to blame, and
he acknowledged it, was in keeping his intentions secret from
the king. Whether if he had communicated them to the king
at an early date, he would have gradually won George over to
his policy, it is impossible to say; he certainly went the wrong
way to work in disregarding the right of the crown to be consulted
on the policy which the prime minister hopes to carry
out.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_374" id="TOPIC_374"></a>The impending resignations were announced in parliament,
and Sir John Mitford, the attorney-general, was chosen speaker
in place of Addington, but the completion of the ministerial
arrangements was delayed, and Pitt remained <i>de facto</i> prime
minister. To prevent public inconvenience he brought forward
his budget on the 18th. He announced a loan of &pound;25,500,000
for Great Britain and &pound;1,500,000 for Ireland, afterwards increased
by another &pound;1,000,000, which the commercial prosperity
of the country, though then in the ninth year of the war, had
enabled him to negotiate, at the rate of about 5&frac14; per cent., and
he proposed fourteen new taxes to defray the interest. The
budget was well received. The delay in the change of ministry
was prolonged by the king's illness. He had been much excited
and distressed by the late events, and on the 20th again became
insane. The Prince of Wales approached Pitt on the subject of
a regency, and Pitt told him that, if the necessity should arise, he
should propose the restrictions of 1789. By March 6 the king's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
condition was materially improved and the question became of
no further importance. George bade Willis, his doctor, tell Pitt
that he was quite well, adding, "but what has he not to answer
for who is the cause of my having been ill at all?" Pitt was
much distressed. Would an assurance, he asked Willis, that he
would not again trouble the king on the catholic question "be
material to his health?" "Certainly," Willis replied, "and to
his life also."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Pitt bade him give the king the assurance. George
was much comforted. <a name="TOPIC_375" id="TOPIC_375"></a>Pitt's surrender has been blamed in strong
terms.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> It cannot be defended completely. The question was of
deep importance to Ireland, and he treated it as a personal matter.
It is, however, unfair to represent his conduct as an attempt to
resume office. His followers constantly urged him to invite
Addington to retire, for they justly regarded him as incompetent,
and when they heard of Pitt's message to the king, they
expected that their wish would be fulfilled. But Addington
had received his appointment, and was not likely to resign it
willingly, and Pitt, as Canning complained, would not make any
"forward movement towards the king". Nothing was to be
got from him except that, if the king and Addington earnestly
wished him to continue, he was ready to discuss matters. On
the strength of this, Dundas and others went to Addington, who
rejected their proposal that he should offer to make way for Pitt,
and Pitt himself told them that their action was improper.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT RESIGNS OFFICE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_376" id="TOPIC_376"></a>Pitt would willingly have continued in office. He loved
power, and he knew that England needed him and the strong
ministry of which he was the head and soul, but he was not a
man to barter principle for office. His message to the king is
intelligible, as a prime minister of our own time has pointed
out, without so mean an interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> He recognised that
while the king lived catholic emancipation could not be gained
save at too high a price. George was sixty-two, and his life
was thought to be precarious; no one could foresee that he
would outlive Pitt, who was twenty years younger. An attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
to force the question on him would have again brought on insanity,
and would perhaps have killed him. Pitt was deeply
moved by the king's words, and yielded to feelings of pity and
personal affection for the sovereign he had served for seventeen
years. On March 14 he gave back the seal of the exchequer
into the king's hands. Once again then, and not for the last
time, did George defeat the policy of his ministers and drive
them from office. In this case the blame chiefly rests on the
traitor Loughborough, who, for his own purposes, happily to be
foiled, interfered between the king and Pitt and excited the
king's religious prejudices. But George's conduct at this crisis
cannot be viewed wholly apart from his earlier attempts at personal
rule, for it proves that he was unable to understand that
his ministers were responsible for his political acts. His refusal
to assent to emancipation deprived Ireland of the happy results
which Pitt expected, and brought much trouble on the country.
As regards its effect on the empire at large, it is enough to say
that it took the helm of state out of the hands of Pitt.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience an attempt is made to classify the
authorities used in writing this volume under different heads; the
plan adopted is unscientific, and books noted under one head belong
partly to others, but it has, perhaps, the one merit of clearness. The
editions quoted here are those which have been used.</p>

<p>(1) General histories of England for the period 1760-1801:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lecky</span>,
<i>History of England in the 18th Century</i>, 8 vols., 1879-90,
from which much help has been obtained. It is a work to which
every historian of the period must be deeply indebted, and though
faults may be found with its plan, it holds a high place among our
histories for learning, moderation, and philosophical treatment. The
history of England is carried down to the outbreak of the war in
1793, that of Ireland to the Union. <span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>, <i>History of England
from the Accession of George III.</i>, 8 vols., 1840-45, a laborious and
impartial record of events, viewed from a conservative standpoint.
<span class="smcap">Massey</span>, <i>History of England</i>, 4 vols., 1855-63, ends 1803, chiefly
treating of home affairs; neither animated nor philosophic, written
from a liberal point of view, unduly severe to the king, but deriving
some value from the author's legal and parliamentary experience.
Lord <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>, <i>History</i>, 7 vols., edit. 1853, vols. iv.-vii., ends 1783,
trustworthy, dull, and whiggish. To these must be added Sir T. E.
<span class="smcap">May</span> (Lord Farnborough), <i>Constitutional History of England from
1760 to 1860</i>, 3 vols., 5th edit., 1875.</p>

<p>(2) The chief manuscript sources consulted:&mdash;The great collection
of the <i>Duke of Newcastle's Papers</i> in Add. MSS., British Museum, extremely
important down to 1767, specially with reference to ministerial
intrigues, the old whig methods of government, the negotiations with
France in 1761-62, and the growth of the cabinet system. The <i>Pitt
Papers</i>, a mass of letters addressed to Pitt (Earl of Chatham) and
William Pitt, and some to Lady Chatham, together with various
political memoranda. These papers have been sorted into different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
bundles, to which the numbers given in my footnotes refer, and a manuscript
index of them has been made by Mrs. Lomas of the Record
Office, where they are at present deposited by their owner. They
have been used in the preparation of the <i>Chatham Correspondence</i>,
and by Lord Stanhope, but the field is large and may be gleaned with
profit. <i>Foreign Office Correspondence</i> (despatches of ambassadors,
etc.). With respect to these, the kind and efficient help given me
by Mr. Hubert Hall, of the Record Office, is gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>(3) Akin to these sources are various publications of the Historical
Manuscripts Commission. Among these special reference should
be made to the Reports on Mr. Fortescue's <i>Dropmore MSS.</i>, 3 vols.,
containing the papers of Lord Grenville, of the highest interest and
importance, specially from 1793; the Duke of Rutland's <i>Belvoir
MSS.</i>, 3 vols., with <i>inter alia</i> the fourth Duke of Rutland's correspondence
while lord-lieutenant of Ireland, 1784-87; the <i>Charlemont
MSS.</i>, also essential for Irish history; <i>Lord Dartmouth's MSS.</i>, vol.
2, American Papers to 1776, and Mrs. <i>Stopford-Sackville's MSS.</i>,
and Sir <i>E. Strachey's MSS.</i>, both throwing much light on the conduct
of the war with America.</p>

<p>(4) Of pre-eminent importance is the <i>Parliamentary History</i>,
xv.-xxxv., and its complement, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Cavendish</span>'s <i>Debates of
the House of Commons</i> during the parliament of 1768, 2 vols., edit.
by Wright, 1841, begins May, 1768, and ends March, 1771. It is
much to be wished that the remainder of these valuable reports
should be published from the manuscript in the British Museum.
Dodsley's <i>Annual Register</i> has historical chapters written by Burke,
perhaps to 1778, and chapters in many later volumes probably written
under his supervision; they are of course generally excellent. The
volumes for the later years of our period contain many useful state
papers. Burke's speeches, pamphlets, and letters, of which the edition
used here is his <i>Works and Correspondence</i>, 8 vols., 1852. For his
life see <span class="smcap">Prior</span>, <i>Life of Burke</i>, 2 vols., 5th edit. (Bohn's Lib.), 1854,
Mr. <span class="smcap">J. Morley</span>, <i>Burke</i>, a historical study, 1867, and <i>Burke</i> (Engl.
Men of Letters Series), 1879.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MEMOIRS AND CORRESPONDENCE.</i></div>

<p>(5) Political and other memoirs and printed correspondence:&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.
Walpole</span> (Lord Orford), <i>Letters</i>, edited by Cunningham, 9 vols.,
1880, the letters in vols. i. and ii. are of earlier dates than 1760.
A more complete edition, in 16 vols., by Mrs. <span class="smcap">P. Toynbee</span>, is in
course of publication by the Clarendon Press. <span class="smcap">Walpole's</span> <i>Memoirs
of the Reign of George III.</i>, 1760-72, edited by Mr. Russell Barker, 4
vols., 1894, and his <i>Journals of the Reign</i>, 1771-83, edited by Doran,
2 vols., 1859. These works are of considerable historical value, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Walpole was not a politician; he was a whig for personal reasons rather
than from conviction, and his sentiments were largely determined by
filial prejudice and the interests of his friends; his views are generally
superficial, and his judgments of persons biassed, sometimes contradictory,
and often unjust. <span class="smcap">Dodington</span> (Lord Melcombe), <i>Diary</i>,
edited by Wyndham, 1785, ending with 1761. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>, <i>Life of Lord
Hardwicke</i>, 3 vols., 1847, useful to 1764, and with an account of
the circumstances preceding C. Yorke's death in 1770, written by his
brother. <span class="smcap">Bisset</span>, <i>Memoirs of Sir Andrew Mitchell</i>, 2 vols., 1850.
Mitchell was ambassador at Berlin in 1760 and later. The Memoirs
are based on his correspondence (Add. MSS. British Museum and
elsewhere), and throw light on the causes of Frederick's angry feelings
towards the British government, and the negotiations for peace in
1762. <i>The Grenville Papers</i>, edited by W. J. Smith, 4 vols., 1852,
consisting principally of the correspondence of Richard, Earl Temple,
and his brother George, first lord of the treasury, 1763-65, together
with George Grenville's diary of "memorable transactions" during
his administration, which gives a full account of the relations between
the king and his first minister. The Papers are of primary importance
for the first eleven years of the reign. [<span class="smcap">Almon</span>,] <i>History of the
Late Minority</i>, 1765, a clever account of the politics of the parliamentary
opposition from 1761, attributed to Lord Temple, and written
in his interest. <i>Correspondence of John, fourth Duke of Bedford</i>, 3
vols., 1846, well edited by Lord John (Earl) Russell, the last part
of vol. ii. and vol. iii. cover from 1760 to 1770. The correspondence
and extracts from the duke's diary afford a striking picture of
the whig system of government by "connexion"; they have much
on the negotiations for the Peace of Paris, the ministerial crises of
1763 and 1765, and the discord between the whigs which was fatal
to their chance of effectually resisting the king's policy. The work
is a necessary complement to the Grenville papers. <i>A Narrative
of the Changes of Ministry, 1765-1767, told by the Duke of Newcastle</i>,
edited by Miss M. Bateson for the Royal Hist. Soc. (Camden Series),
1898, from the Newcastle Papers (see sec. 2), giving an interesting
account of the king's efforts to supply the place of the Grenville
ministry, the difficulties both on the king's side and that of Pitt
which kept Pitt out of office, the duke's discomfiture when the king
put Pitt in power in July, 1766, and his attempt in 1767 to arrange
a coalition between Grafton and the Rockingham party.</p>

<p>The lack of any sufficient biography of Chatham renders <i>The
Chatham Correspondence</i>, 4 vols., 1840 (see sec. 2, <i>Pitt Papers</i>), well
edited by Taylor and Captain Pringle, of peculiar importance; vols.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
ii.-iv. contain letters both from and to Chatham, which illustrate the
whole of his career during our period. Pitt's political position and
conduct, 1761-65, and specially his relations with Bute, are the subject
of an interesting study, <i>William Pitt und Graf Bute</i>, by Dr. <span class="smcap">A.
von Ruville</span>, Berlin, 1895. <i>William Pitt, Earl of Chatham</i> (Heroes
of the Nation Series), by Mr. <span class="smcap">W. D. Green</span>, M.P., 1901, is good
from 1760, so far as its limits allow. Earl of <span class="smcap">Albemarle</span>, <i>Memoirs
of the Marquis of Rockingham</i>, 2 vols., 1852, an ill-arranged book,
has letters of value, exhibits the policy of the Rockingham whigs,
their differences with Pitt (Chatham), and their efforts for reform.
<i>Autobiography and Political Correspondence of the Duke of Grafton</i>,
1898, edited by Sir <span class="smcap">William Anson</span>, with an excellent introduction
and useful footnotes, gives valuable notices of the first Rockingham
ministry, the weakness of the administration formed under Chatham,
the collapse of all ministerial vigour during his illness and when
Grafton was nominally at the head of affairs, and the views of the
whigs with regard to the constitution. <i>The Correspondence of George
III. with Lord North</i>, 1768-83, 2 vols., 1867, edited by W. B. Donne,
with copious notes and comments, shows the king's system of personal
rule through his ministers in full working, the position held by
North under it, and his unavailing attempts to resign office when
forced to carry out a policy he disapproved, together with much that
concerns the conduct of the war. Lord <span class="smcap">Edmond Fitzmaurice</span>, <i>Life
of the Earl of Shelburne</i> (Marquis of Lansdowne), 3 vols., 1875-76,
based on papers at Lansdowne House and elsewhere, represents
Shelburne's political conduct in as favourable a light as possible;
the parts relating to the quarrel between Shelburne and H. Fox in
vol. i., the negotiations in Paris in 1782 and 1783, and the quarrel
with C. J. Fox, are perhaps specially useful, but the whole work
down to 1784 is necessary and authoritative.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>, <i>Life of Pitt</i>, 4 vols., 2nd edit., 1862, founded
on unpublished papers (see sec. 2, <i>Pitt Papers</i>); a good biography
and a standard and indispensable work. With this should be read
Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, <i>Pitt</i> (Twelve English Statesmen Series), 1891, an admirable
appreciation of Pitt's work and character. Lord <span class="smcap">John</span> (Earl)
<span class="smcap">Russell</span>, <i>Memorials and Correspondence of C. J. Fox</i>, 4 vols., 1853,
has many letters of importance, but is otiosely edited, and <i>Life of
C. J. Fox</i>, 3 vols., 1859-67, more concerned with politics, which it
treats from a strongly whig standpoint, than with biography. Sir <span class="smcap">G. O.
Trevelyan</span>, <i>Early History of C. J. Fox</i>, 1880, written on the whig
side, ends with 1774. <i>Court and Cabinets of George III.</i>, edited by
the Duke of Buckingham, 4 vols., 1853-55 (vol. i. begins at 1782, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
1801 is reached early in vol. iii.), contains the correspondence of the
brothers Lord Temple (later Marquis of Buckingham), Thomas, and
W. W. Grenville (later Lord Grenville); the letters of the last named
are of much value; they are supplemented by the <i>Dropmore MSS.</i>
(see sec. 2). <i>Diaries and Correspondence of the First Earl of Malmesbury</i>,
4 vols., 1844, edited by the third earl, chiefly concerned with
the foreign relations of Great Britain; his despatches, letters, and
journal while minister at St. Petersburg, 1770-80, at the Hague,
1784-88, at Berlin, 1793, and during his mission to Paris in 1796,
and to Lille in 1797, are of first-rate importance. In vol. ii. are
reports of two conferences with the Prince of Wales on the subject
of his debts in 1785. Malmesbury (Sir James Harris) was one of
the Portland whigs, joined in their secession, and was much trusted
by Pitt. <i>Correspondence of Marquis Cornwallis</i>, 3 vols., 1859, well
edited by C. Ross, has several letters relating to the war with America,
an account of his interview with Frederick of Prussia in 1785, many
despatches and letters written by him as governor-general of India,
1786-92, and a large mass of correspondence during his vice-royalty
of Ireland, 1798-1801. <i>Journal and Correspondence of Lord Auckland</i>,
4 vols., 1861-62, edited feebly by Lord Auckland, Bishop of
Bath and Wells. Auckland (Eden) was a personal friend of Pitt until
1801. His letters while ambassador at Paris, 1785-87; correspondence
relating to the regency question, 1788; his letters from the
Hague, 1792-93; some on the course of the war, and those referring
to the recall of Fitzwilliam and to the catholic question in 1801, are
to be noted. He was chief secretary for Ireland in 1780, and was
closely allied with Beresford and the protestant ascendency party.
<i>Political Memoranda of the Duke of Leeds</i>, edited by Mr. O. Browning
for the Camden Soc., 1884, specially valuable for its account
of the whig scheme for a coalition in 1792. Also edited by Mr.
Browning, <i>Despatches of Earl Gower</i>, 1885. Gower was ambassador
at Paris, 1790-92. Lady <span class="smcap">Minto</span>, <i>Life of Sir Gilbert Elliot, afterwards
Lord Minto, to 1806</i>, 3 vols., 1874; vol. i. contains information
as to the illness of the king and the regency question; vol. ii. as to
the secession of the Portland whigs; Elliot, whose sister married Lord
Auckland, and whose wife was a sister of Lady Malmesbury, was one
of the party. His letters, while he was employed on a diplomatic
mission at Toulon during the siege, as viceroy of Corsica, at Naples,
and as minister at Vienna, 1799-1801, are worthy of attention. Sir
<span class="smcap">N. W. Wraxall</span>, <i>Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</i>, 1772-84, 5
vols., 1884, carefully edited by Mr. H. B. Wheatley, diffuse and
amusing. Wraxall's inaccuracies, or worse, have been exaggerated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
and his work, which goes to 1789, together with some later "reminiscences,"
is of value, specially as regards its portraiture of public men
of a secondary rank. Wraxall was a follower of North until 1783, and
afterwards, until he resigned his seat in 1794, generally supported
Pitt. <i>Diaries and Correspondence of George Rose</i>, 2 vols., 1860,
edited by L. V. Harcourt. Rose was secretary to the treasury during
the whole of Pitt's first administration, and was intimate with him.
Vol. i. contains, among other matters, an account of Pitt's resignation;
vol. ii. has some reminiscences which the king communicated
to Rose in 1804. <i>The Diary and Correspondence of Abbot, Lord
Colchester</i>, edited by his son, 3 vols., 1861, vol. i. and <span class="smcap">Pellew</span>,
<i>Life of Lord Sidmouth</i> (Addington), 3 vols., 1847, vol. i. should be
consulted for the circumstances of Pitt's retirement. Lord <span class="smcap">Holland</span>,
<i>Memoirs of the Whig Party</i>, 2 vols., 1852, edited by his son, Lord
Holland. As the writer was the nephew of Fox, who was much
attached to him, and by 1800 was himself a prominent member of
the party, these papers have great authority; many of them refer to
events and persons belonging to our period. Along with much else
which does not concern political history, the <i>Life of William Wilberforce</i>,
by his sons, 5 vols., 1838, contains some interesting notices of
public affairs before 1801, along with a record of Wilberforce's efforts
in and out of parliament for the abolition of the slave trade. See
also <i>Private Papers of W. Wilberforce</i>, 1897, with a character of Pitt
by Wilberforce.</p>

<p>(6) Miscellaneous books, pamphlets, etc. On public finance,
see <span class="smcap">Hamilton</span>, <i>Inquiry concerning ... the National Debt</i>, 1813;
<span class="smcap">Newmarch</span>, <i>On the Loans Raised by Mr. Pitt</i>, 1793-1801, a highly
valuable and interesting treatise; <i>Parliamentary Report, Accounts</i>,
xxxiii., 1858, on the national debt, and <span class="smcap">S. Dowell</span>, <i>History of Taxation
in England</i>, 4 vols., 1884. On the commercial treaty with France
of 1786, see Count <span class="smcap">de Butenval</span>, <i>Pr&eacute;cis du Trait&eacute; de Commerce</i>, 1786,
Paris, 1869, and Auckland Corr. as above. Some of the articles by
Sir <span class="smcap">G. C. Lewis</span>, <i>Administrations of Great Britain</i>, 1783-1830, edited
by Sir E. Head, 1864, are founded on Memoirs, etc., noted in sec.
5, and are excellent commentaries on them. The private life of the
king is written by <span class="smcap">Jesse</span>, <i>Memoirs of the Life and Reign of George
III.</i>, 3 vols., 2nd edit., 1867, in itself scarcely to be reckoned as
of historical value, but giving copious references to authorities. Life
at the court is vividly described in Madame <span class="smcap">D'Arblay's</span> (Miss
Burney's) <i>Diary</i>, 7 vols., 1854; a new edition by Mr. Austin Dobson
is in course of publication. The Diary should be read with an allowance
for the writer's dislike of her work at court, which Macaulay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
does not perhaps sufficiently consider in his essay. His other essays
relating to this period should be read, but the views of history which
they present must not be accepted in all cases. Bishop <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>,
<i>Seasonable Hints from an Honest Man</i>, 1761; <i>Case of the Troops
Serving in Germany</i>, 1781; <span class="smcap">Mauduit</span>, <i>Occasional Thoughts on the
Present German War, 1761,</i> and other pamphlets. Many of the
Caricatures of <i>Gillray</i>, <i>Rowlandson</i>, and others are valuable as
historical documents. In default of the originals, see <span class="smcap">Wright</span>, <i>England
under the House of Hanover</i>, 2 vols., 3rd edit., 1852, republished
in one vol. as <i>Caricature History of the Georges</i> [1867?].</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON THE AMERICAN REBELLION.</i></div>

<p>(7) Of books on the American revolutionary war the best general
history of a popular kind is by Mr. <span class="smcap">Fiske</span>, <i>American Revolution</i>,
2 vols., 1891; it is written with moderation and a desire for impartiality.
<span class="smcap">Gordon</span>, <i>History of the Rise of the Independence of the
United States</i>, 4 vols., 1788, with many documents. <span class="smcap">G. Bancroft</span>,
<i>History of the United States</i>, centenary edition, 1879, vols. iii.-vi.
containing the history of the revolution, display wonderful industry,
but are disfigured by violent partisanship. <i>Narrative and Critical
History of America</i>, edited by J. Winsor, vol. vi., 1888, has some
good papers by various writers. <i>Cambridge Modern History</i>, vol. vii.,
<i>The United States</i>, 1903. <span class="smcap">Tyler</span>, <i>Literary History of the American
Revolution</i>, 2 vols., 1879, illustrates the course of American sentiment
during the period. Sir <span class="smcap">G. O. Trevelyan</span>, <i>The American Revolution</i>,
pts. i. and ii., 3 vols., in progress, written on the whig side: the
views taken in the present book as to the causes and character of
the dispute, and as to some other points are different from those
advanced by this distinguished author. For the loyalists, <span class="smcap">L. Sabine</span>,
<i>American Loyalists</i>, Boston, 1847, revised edit., <i>Biographies, etc.</i>,
2 vols., 1864, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Flick</span>, <i>Loyalism in New York</i> (Columbia
University Studies, xiv.). The best purely military history of the
war is by <span class="smcap">Stedman</span>, <i>History of the American War</i>, 2 vols., 4to,
1794; he served under Howe, Clinton, and Cornwallis, and his
book is a standard authority. <span class="smcap">Tarleton</span>, <i>Campaigns of 1780, 1781
in the Southern Provinces, 1787.</i> Other books consulted are <i>Washington's
Writings and Life,</i> by <span class="smcap">Sparks</span>, 12 vols., Boston, 1833-39;
<span class="smcap">Franklin</span>, <i>Works</i>, edit. Bigelow, 10 vols., N.Y., 1887-88; <span class="smcap">Tudor</span>,
<i>Life of Otis</i>, Boston, 1823; <i>Diary and Letters of Thomas Hutchinson</i>,
edited by P. Hutchinson, 2 vols., 1883, 1886; <span class="smcap">Frothingham</span>,
<i>Siege of Boston,</i> 1849, a careful piece of work, though written in
a remarkably vainglorious tone; Mr. <span class="smcap">Codman</span>, <i>Arnold's Expedition
to Quebec</i>, New York, 1902, an excellent and interesting monograph;
<span class="smcap">Kingsford</span>, <i>History of Canada</i>, vol. v., 1892, also deals with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
expedition. <span class="smcap">Johnston</span>, <i>Campaign of</i> 1776 (Long Island Hist. Soc.),
1878, a good narrative well furnished with documentary proofs, and
by the same, <i>The Yorktown Campaign</i>, New York, 1881. Judge
<span class="smcap">Jones</span>, <i>History of New York during the War</i>, 2 vols., New York,
1879-80, edited by Mr. De Lancy, a book of special interest, for
Jones was a loyalist; it is written with vigour, and censures the
misdeeds on both sides alike. For Burgoyne's expedition&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">J.
Burgoyne</span>, <i>State of the Expedition from Canada</i>, 1779, with his
defence before the house of commons; <span class="smcap">Fonblanque</span>, <i>Episodes from
the Life of Burgoyne</i>, 1876, and Lieut. <span class="smcap">Hadden</span>, <i>Journal and
Orderly-books</i>, 1886. For Howe's conduct of the war&mdash;<i>Examination
of Joseph Galloway before the House of Commons</i>, 1779; [Galloway,]
<i>Letters to a Nobleman</i>, 1779, Galloway, a Philadelphian
lawyer of large property, joined the British in 1776; Sir <span class="smcap">W. Howe</span>,
<i>Narrative</i> before a committee of the house of commons, April 29, 1779,
with <i>Observations on Letters to a Nobleman</i>, 1780; <i>Detail and Conduct
of the War</i>, including the celebrated <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, 1780.
Mr. <span class="smcap">M'Crady</span> in his <i>History of South Carolina</i>: i. <i>Under Royal
Government</i>, New York, 1899, an able book, shows how the desire
for independence gained ground in the provinces; vols. ii. and iii.
<i>In the Revolution</i>, 1902, contain a careful but tedious narrative,
which seems to err in exalting the partisan commanders, Marion and
Sumter, at the expense of Greene. <i>The Clinton-Cornwallis Controversy</i>,
2 vols., 1888, edited with minute care by the late Mr. <span class="smcap">B. F.
Stevens</span>, and containing all the official letters, orders, and the like
of the campaigns in the Carolinas; this elaborate work is essential
for forming a judgment on the controversy between the two generals.
Other authorities more or less bearing on the quarrel with the colonies
and the subsequent war are noted in other sections.</p>

<p>(8) On military matters generally:&mdash;Colonel the Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Edward
Cust</span>, <i>Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century</i>, iii.-v., 3rd edit.,
1862; the Hon. <span class="smcap">J. W. Fortescue</span>, <i>A History of the British Army</i>,
3 vols., 1899-1902, in progress, an important work to which this
volume is indebted, though the view with regard to Clinton and
Cornwallis taken by Mr. Fortescue is widely different from that
adopted here; <span class="smcap">M. Chuquet</span>, <i>La jeunesse de Napoleon, Toulon</i>, 1897,
and <i>Guerres de la R&eacute;volution</i>, 11 vols., in progress, an important
work, vol. x. <i>Valenciennes</i>, vol. xi. <i>Hondschoote</i>; Sir <span class="smcap">H. Bunbury</span>,
<i>Narratives of the Great War with France</i>, 1854, begins with the
campaign in Holland of 1799; <span class="smcap">Drinkwater</span>, <i>History of the Siege
of Gibraltar</i>, Dublin, 1793; <span class="smcap">C. J. Fox</span>, <i>Napoleon Bonaparte and
the Siege of Toulon</i>, Washington, U.S.A., 1902; Dr. <span class="smcap">Holland Rose</span>,
<i>Life of Napoleon I.</i>, 2 vols., 1902, and some other works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON NAVAL HISTORY.</i></div>

<p>(9) For naval history:&mdash;Captain <span class="smcap">Mahan</span>, <i>Influence of Sea Power
upon History</i>, 1889, <i>Influence of Sea Power on the French Revolution</i>,
2 vols., 4th edit., 1892, and <i>Life of Nelson</i>, 2 vols., 1897, books to
which all students of the history of the eighteenth century are deeply
indebted. <span class="smcap">James</span>, <i>Naval History of Great Britain</i>, 6 vols., edit.
1837; vols. i.-iii. include from 1793 to 1801, a famous work which
is still of high authority on naval engagements and tactics, the size
and classes of ships, the number and character of their guns, etc.,
but it neither explains nor criticises strategy. <span class="smcap">Brenton</span>, <i>Naval
History of Great Britain, 1783-1822</i>, 5 vols., 1823, uncritical and
inaccurate, though as the work of a naval officer in active service,
who had a part in some of the events it describes, it has a certain
importance. Sir <span class="smcap">W. L. Clowes</span>, <i>The Royal Navy</i>, vol. iv., 1899.
<span class="smcap">T. Keppel</span>, <i>Life of Viscount Keppel</i>, 2 vols., 1842. <span class="smcap">Mundy</span>, <i>Life of
Rodney</i>, 2 vols., 1830. Mr. <span class="smcap">D. Hannay</span>, <i>Rodney</i> (English Men of
Action Series), 1891, an admirable little book, and his edition of
the <i>Letters of Sir S. (Viscount) Hood</i> (Navy Records Soc.), 1895,
exhibiting the determining effect of naval failure on the part of
England on the last phase of the war with America. <span class="smcap">Barrow</span>, <i>Life
of Earl Howe</i>, 1838. Mr. <span class="smcap">J. K. Laughton</span>, <i>Nelson</i> (English Men
of Action Series), 1895, by an acknowledged master of English naval
history, and his articles in the <i>Dict. of National Biography</i> on the
sea-captains of the period. <i>Logs of the Great Sea Fights, 1794-1805</i>
(Navy Records Soc.), vol. i., 1899, in progress, well edited by Rear-Admiral
T. Sturges Jackson, a delightful book of first-rate value.
References to the latest contributions to the subject of Nelson at
Naples are given in the text. <span class="smcap">Chevalier</span>, <i>Histoire de la Marine Fran&ccedil;aise
pendant la Guerre de l'Ind&eacute;pendence Americaine</i>, 1877, <i>Histoire,
etc., sous la premi&egrave;re R&eacute;publique</i>, 1886, most valuable works; a third
vol., <i>Hist., etc., sous le Consulat</i>. M. le Capitaine <span class="smcap">Desbri&egrave;re</span>, <i>Projets
de D&eacute;barquement</i>, 2 vols., 1901, a phase of the great war told with all
the care and lucidity which distinguish the best French historical work.</p>

<p>(10) For European politics during the French revolution the best
books are by <span class="smcap">Heinrich von Sybel</span>, used here in the French translation,
<i>Histoire de l'Europe pendant la R&eacute;volution Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, 6 vols., 1869-88,
and by M. <span class="smcap">Albert Sorel</span>, <i>L'Europe et la R&eacute;volution Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, 6
vols., 1903, in progress; vol. vi. covers 1800-5, a work distinguished
alike by learning, insight, and literary quality; the great collection of
<span class="smcap">G. F. von Martens</span>, <i>Recueil des Trait&eacute;s depuis 1761</i>, vols. i.-vi.,
1817-29; Comte <span class="smcap">de Garden</span>, <i>Histoire des Trait&eacute;s</i>, vols. iv.-vi.,
1848-87, and <span class="smcap">F. de Martens</span>, <i>Recueil des Trait&eacute;s conclus par la
Russie</i>, vols. ix., x. (<i>Angleterre</i>), 1892.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>(11) In Irish history <span class="smcap">Lecky</span> has generally been followed, supplemented
by <span class="smcap">Plowden</span>, <i>History of Ireland to the Union</i>, 2 vols., 1809;
<span class="smcap">H. Grattan</span>, <i>Life of Grattan</i>, 5 vols., 1839; <i>Correspondence between
Pitt and the Duke of Rutland</i>, 1781-87, edit. 1890. Earl <span class="smcap">Fitzwilliam</span>,
<i>First</i> and <i>Second Letters to the Earl of Carlisle</i>, 1795;
<span class="smcap">Tone</span>, <i>Life of T. W. Tone</i>, 2 vols., 1826; <span class="smcap">Madden</span>, <i>United Irishmen</i>,
2 vols., 2nd edit., 1858; <span class="smcap">Gordon</span>, <i>History of the Rebellion</i>, 2nd
edit., 1803, a trustworthy and graphic narrative by a protestant
clergyman of co. Wexford; <i>Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount
Castlereagh</i> (Lord Londonderry), 12 vols., 1848-85, vols. ii.-iv.;
<span class="smcap">Ingram</span>, <i>History of the Irish Union</i>, 1887, though failing in its hopeless
attempt to prove that the union was not effected by corrupt
means, a book well worth reading; <i>Cornwallis Correspondence</i> and
some other books already noted.</p>

<p>(12) For Indian matters:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mill</span> and <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, <i>History of British
India</i>, 10 vols., 1858, vols. iii.-vi., a standard work; Sir <span class="smcap">J. F. Stephen</span>,
<i>Story of Nuncomar</i>, 2 vols., 1885; Mr. <span class="smcap">G. Forrest</span>, <i>Selections from
State Papers, India</i>, 1772-85, 3 vols., 1890, documents of first-rate
importance, well edited, with good introduction, which, perhaps, attempts
too complete a defence of Hastings; Sir <span class="smcap">A. Lyall</span>, <i>Warren
Hastings</i> (English Men of Action Series), 1902, a thoroughly sound
and well-considered biography; Mr. <span class="smcap">S. J. Owen</span>, <i>Selections from
the Despatches of Marquess Wellesley</i>, 1877, with the <i>Cornwallis
Correspondence</i> already noted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON ECONOMIC PROGRESS.</i></div>

<p>(13) For the social and economic history in chap, xiii., a general
account will be found in <span class="smcap">Lecky</span>, <i>History</i>, vol. v., an admirable and
delightful piece of work; <i>Social England</i>, vol. v., 1896, edited by
<span class="smcap">Traill</span>, papers of various merit by various authors; a new edition
with well-chosen illustrations is now (1904) published; and chapters
at the end of vols. vii. and ix. of the <i>Pictorial History of England</i>,
edited by <span class="smcap">Craik</span> and <span class="smcap">Macfarlane</span>, 1841, 1843. Manners and
customs are described by Mr. <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>, <i>England and the English in
the Eighteenth Century</i>, 2 vols., 1891, and by Mr. <span class="smcap">Ashton</span>, whose <i>Old
Times</i>, 1885, is almost wholly composed of newspaper cuttings and
caricatures, and is, therefore, so far as it goes, a contemporary authority.
Notices of the gambling and frivolity of a portion of the upper class,
some not before printed, are given in Sir <span class="smcap">G. Trevelyan's</span> <i>Early Life
of C. J. Fox</i> (see above). An independent study should include the
chronicle in the <i>Annual Register, Walpole's Letters</i>, <span class="smcap">Jesse</span>, <i>George
Selwyn and his Contemporaries</i>, 4 vols., 1843, and <i>Selwyn's Letters</i>,
edited by Mr. Roscoe and Miss Clergue, 1899; <span class="smcap">Smollett</span>, <i>Humphrey
Clinker</i>, written in 1770; <span class="smcap">Anstey</span>, <i>New Bath Guide</i>, "poetical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
epistles describing life at Bath" in 1766; Miss <span class="smcap">Burney</span>, <i>Evelina</i>, in
1778, and many other books. A good introduction to the literary
history of the period is given by Mr. <span class="smcap">G. Saintsbury</span>, <i>Short History
of English Literature</i>, 1898. Though the late Sir <span class="smcap">Leslie Stephen</span>
in his <i>English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i>, 2 vols., 2nd edit.,
1881, deals chiefly with the earlier part of the century, he has much
of the highest value, specially in chaps. x. and xi., on writers of this
period; see also his articles on them in the <i>Dict. of National Biography</i>.
Church history is carefully treated by <span class="smcap">Abbey</span> and <span class="smcap">Overton</span>,
<i>The English Church in the Eighteenth Century</i>, ed. 1887. For the
administration of the criminal law&mdash;Major <span class="smcap">Griffith</span>, <i>Chronicles of
Newgate</i>, 2 vols., 1884. For prisons&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Howard</span>, <i>The State of
the Prisons</i>, 4th edit., 1792. For the police arrangements of London&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colquhoun</span>,
<i>Treatise on the Police</i>, 1795.</p>

<p>On economic and industrial history the latest and best authority
is Dr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>, <i>Growth of English Industry and Commerce,
Modern Times</i>, pts. i. and ii., 2 vols., 1903. Other books used
are <span class="smcap">Craik</span>, in <i>Pictorial History</i> as above, republished in his <i>History
of British Commerce</i>, 1844; <span class="smcap">Macpherson</span>, <i>Annals of Commerce</i>, 4
vols., 1805; <span class="smcap">McCulloch</span>, edition of <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>, <i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
1863; <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, <i>Six Centuries of Work and Wages</i>, 2 vols., 1884,
and his <i>Industrial and Commercial History of England</i>, lectures, 2
vols., 1898, and <span class="smcap">Warner</span>, <i>Landmarks in English Industrial History</i>,
1899, a useful and well-arranged little book. For the cotton manufacture&mdash;Sir
<span class="smcap">E. Baines</span>, <i>History of the Cotton Manufacture</i>, 1836.
With reference to agriculture and the poor&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Young</span>, <i>Six Weeks'
Tour in the Southern Counties</i>, 1769, and <i>Tour through the North</i>,
4 vols., 1770, present the condition of agriculture at the time, with
lists of wages and the expenses of the labouring class; Rev. <span class="smcap">J. Howlett</span>,
pamphlets on the <i>Influence of Enclosures</i>, 1786, and the <i>Causes
of the Increase of the Poor</i>, 1786; Mr. <span class="smcap">R. E. Prothero</span>, <i>Pioneers and
Progress of English Farming</i>, 1888, an excellent account; Sir <span class="smcap">G. A.
Nicholls</span>, <i>History of the English Poor Law</i>, 2 vols., 1898, and Mr.
